 * Migration to create missing narrative records for existing incidents

 * Context: Some incidents were created before the narrative initialization logic
 * was added to the frontend. When users navigate directly to Step 2 (narrative)
 * without going through Step 1, the narrative doesn't exist and auto-save crashes.
 *
 * This migration ensures all incidents have a corresponding narrative record.
