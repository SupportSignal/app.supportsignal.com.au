Her morning medications had been administered correctly at 8:00 AM with no issues.",

However, upon checking the medication chart immediately after administration, they realized they had given Emma two tablets instead of the prescribed one tablet. Emma had already swallowed both tablets before the error was noticed. The worker immediately checked Emma for any immediate reactions and found none.",
      end_event: "The medication error was identified within 2 minutes of administration. Emma showed no immediate adverse reactions - her vital signs appeared normal, she was alert and responsive, and complained of no symptoms. The support worker immediately contacted the on-call nurse at 2:32 PM to report the incident and seek medical advice.",
      post_event: "The on-call nurse advised monitoring Emma for the next 4 hours for any signs of overdose symptoms. Emma's doctor was contacted and advised that the additional 500mg of Paracetamol was not life-threatening but required monitoring. Emma remained stable throughout the monitoring period. Incident was reported to management at 3:00 PM. A review of medication procedures has been scheduled to prevent similar errors."

The activity hall floor was clean and dry.",

Despite staff assistance and following the transfer procedure, Michael lost his balance during the transfer. He fell backward and hit his head on the corner of a nearby table. Staff immediately attended to Michael, who was conscious but complained of head pain.",

Michael was kept still while emergency services were called at 4:50 PM. His wheelchair was checked and found to be functioning normally - the fall appeared to be related to the transfer process.",

The scan showed no serious injury, but he was advised to rest and monitor for concussion symptoms. Michael's family and support coordinator were notified. A review of transfer procedures and equipment has been initiated. Michael returned home that evening with instructions for 24-hour observation."

Sarah raised her voice and began using inappropriate language directed at the other participant and staff. When a staff member attempted to de-escalate the situation, Sarah became more aggressive, shouting and making threatening gestures but did not make physical contact.",
      end_event: "Staff implemented the de-escalation protocol, removing other participants from the immediate area and speaking calmly to Sarah. After approximately 10 minutes, Sarah began to calm down. She was offered the opportunity to take a break in a quiet space, which she accepted. Sarah expressed remorse about her behavior and explained she was frustrated about her sleep issues.",
      post_event: "Sarah spent 30 minutes in the quiet room with a support worker, using breathing techniques to calm down. She was then able to rejoin the group for the next activity. A behavior support meeting was scheduled for the following week to review Sarah's support strategies. Sarah's sleep issues were noted for discussion with her healthcare team."

Water began flowing rapidly from behind the toilet, flooding the bathroom floor and beginning to spread into the bedroom area. James immediately called for help from the support worker, who arrived within 1 minute and saw the extent of the water damage.",

James was moved to the living area to ensure his safety while the water was contained. The water had flooded the bathroom completely and damaged some personal items in the bedroom. No injuries occurred, but James was distressed about his routine being disrupted.",

James was relocated to a temporary unit for 24 hours while repairs were completed. Insurance was notified and a claim was processed. James's routine was maintained as much as possible in the temporary accommodation."

She had taken her evening medication as prescribed at 6:00 PM and showed no signs of illness or distress.",

The support worker immediately implemented the seizure management protocol, ensuring Rachel's safety by clearing the area and placing her in the recovery position. The seizure lasted approximately 3 minutes. The support worker timed the seizure and observed Rachel's breathing and responsiveness throughout.",
      end_event: "The seizure ended at 7:23 PM. Rachel remained unconscious for 2 minutes post-seizure, which is typical for her seizure pattern. She gradually regained consciousness and was confused but responsive. The support worker continued to monitor her vital signs and provided reassurance. Rachel complained of feeling tired and had a mild headache, both normal post-seizure symptoms for her.",
      post_event: "The support worker contacted Rachel's on-call doctor at 7:30 PM to report the seizure. As this was Rachel's first seizure in 6 months, the doctor advised monitoring but no immediate hospital visit was required.
