## Dev Notes

### Current Deployment Infrastructure

**Deployment Platforms:**
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Automated deployment from GitHub main branch
- **Convex**: Manual deployment via `bunx convex deploy`
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Manual deployment via Wrangler (through Bun scripts)
  - **Worker Name**: `supportsignal-log-ingestion-worker`
  - **Deployment Script**: `scripts/deploy-worker.sh` (guided interactive deployment)
  - **Package Scripts**:
    - `bun run worker:deploy` → calls `wrangler deploy` (development environment)
    - `bun run worker:deploy:production` → calls `wrangler deploy --env production`
    - `bun run worker:dev` → calls `wrangler dev` (local development)
  - **Configuration**: `apps/workers/log-ingestion/wrangler.toml`
  - **Secrets Required**: `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
  - **Durable Objects**: RateLimiterDO for rate limiting state management

**Configuration Management:**
- **Source of Truth**: `~/.env-configs/app.supportsignal.com.au.env`
- **Deployment Tool**: `scripts/sync-env.js` with multiple modes
- **Environment Files**: Generated automatically for local development

### Cloudflare Worker Architecture
[Source: apps/workers/log-ingestion/]

**Worker Infrastructure:**
- **Primary Function**: AI-first logging system with Redis backend
- **Core Components**:
  - Log ingestion endpoint with rate limiting
  - Durable Objects for distributed rate limit state
  - Redis client for log storage (Upstash)
  - Health check and monitoring endpoints
  - Log retrieval and trace management

**Deployment Architecture:**
```
Wrangler CLI → Cloudflare Edge
├── Development Environment (workers.dev subdomain)
│   ├── Development secrets
│   ├── Development Durable Objects
│   └── Development rate limits
└── Production Environment (custom domain/route)
    ├── Production secrets
    ├── Production Durable Objects
    └── Production rate limits
```

**Key Files:**
- `apps/workers/log-ingestion/src/index.ts` - Main worker entry point
- `apps/workers/log-ingestion/src/rate-limiter.ts` - Durable Object implementation
- `apps/workers/log-ingestion/src/redis-client.ts` - Redis integration
- `apps/workers/log-ingestion/wrangler.toml` - Deployment configuration
- `scripts/deploy-worker.sh` - Automated deployment script

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Unit tests: `tests/workers/log-ingestion/`
- Test scripts: `bun run test:worker`, `bun run test:worker:coverage`
- Mock implementations for Durable Objects and Redis

### Available CI/CD Monitoring Tools
[Source: CLAUDE.md CI Verification Scripts & Monitoring Tools]

**Existing Scripts:**
- `bun run ci:status` - Check current CI status
- `bun run ci:watch` - Monitor CI execution with timeout
- `bun run push` - Smart push with CI integration
- `bun run ci:logs` - View detailed CI logs

**Integration Capabilities:**
- GitHub CLI integration for authenticated API access
- Exit code standards for automation
- Real-time monitoring with configurable timeouts

### Environment Management System Status
[Source: Epic 8 Environment Management System Operations]

**Current Architecture:**
```
LOCAL MODE:
~/.env-configs/[project].env → Local files (ALWAYS dev values)

DEPLOYMENT MODE:
~/.env-configs/[project].env → Cloud platforms (dev/prod values)
```

**Critical Principle**: Local `.env.local` files NEVER contain production values

### Previous Story Dependencies

**From Story 8.1** - Environment separation established:
- Production deployment verification procedures needed
- Data migration procedures documented
- Environment isolation validation required

**From Story 8.2** - URL configuration system implemented:
- Centralized configuration module available at `apps/convex/lib/urlConfig.ts`
- Environment detection patterns established
- URL generation validation procedures needed

**From Story 8.3** - OAuth production setup completed:
- OAuth application management procedures established
- Authentication workflow testing patterns available
- Environment-specific authentication verification needed

### Coding Standards Compliance
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Documentation Standards:**
- All procedures must include step-by-step instructions
- Include error handling and troubleshooting steps
- Provide verification procedures for each deployment step
- Document rollback procedures for each deployment component

**Script Requirements:**
- All automation scripts must include proper error handling
- Use correlation IDs for logging and traceability
- Follow established exit code standards
- Include dry-run capabilities where appropriate

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/testing/technical/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Deployment Testing:**
- Verify deployment procedures in development environment first
- Test rollback procedures without impacting production
- Validate configuration management scripts with dry-run modes
- Implement automated verification of deployment success

**Test Locations:**
- Deployment scripts: `scripts/` directory
- Verification tests: `tests/deployment/` directory
- Configuration tests: `tests/configuration/` directory

### Critical Integration Points

**GitHub Actions Pipeline:**
- Current CI/CD pipeline includes linting, testing, building, and deployment
- Integration with Cloudflare Pages auto-deployment
- Need to document troubleshooting procedures for pipeline failures

**Multi-Platform Coordination:**
- Convex deployment independent of Cloudflare Pages
- Worker deployment separate from main application via Wrangler CLI
- Environment variable synchronization across platforms
- **Worker-Specific Coordination:**
  - Worker deployment via `wrangler deploy --env [development|production]`
  - Worker secrets managed separately from environment variables
  - Durable Objects require migration management (defined in wrangler.toml)
  - Redis backend configuration independent of Convex/Pages
  - Worker URL must be configured in both Next.js and Convex environments
  - Worker endpoints: `/log`, `/health`, `/logs?trace_id=xxx`, `/traces/recent`, `/logs/clear`

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
- Need procedures for monitoring deployment health
- Configuration drift detection across environments
- Performance impact monitoring for deployments

## QA Results

### Pattern Compliance Review
*To be populated by QA agent*

### Knowledge Capture

**KDD Process Completed**: 2025-10-01

**Knowledge Assets Created:**

1. **Operations Documentation Section** - Added to `docs/index.md`
   - New "🚀 Operations & Deployment" section with 6 comprehensive guides
   - Organized by: Deployment Operations, Configuration Management, CI/CD Operations
   - Includes reference to 6 verification scripts in `scripts/` directory

2. **Patterns Established:**
   - **Multi-Platform Deployment Pattern** - Unified deployment framework for Pages/Convex/Workers
   - **Single Source of Truth Configuration** - Environment-specific deployment from centralized config
   - **Automated Verification Pattern** - Bash-based health checks with exit codes for CI/CD
   - **Platform-Specific Rollback Pattern** - Tailored rollback procedures per deployment platform
   - **Configuration Drift Detection Pattern** - Automated comparison and remediation workflow

3. **Reusable Examples:**
   - `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` - Template for multi-platform deployment verification (lines 46-260)
   - `scripts/verify-worker-health.sh` - Template for comprehensive service health checks (lines 78-280)
   - `scripts/check-config-drift.sh` - Template for configuration drift detection (complete script)
   - `docs/operations/rollback-procedures.md` - Incident response decision matrix and rollback workflows

4. **Lessons Learned:**
   - **macOS Compatibility**: Use `date +%s` (seconds) not `date +%s%3N` (milliseconds) for cross-platform bash scripts
   - **Environment Detection Logic**: Production verification should use hardcoded URLs, not local .env.local files
   - **Worker-Specific Considerations**: Durable Objects state persists across deployments, requiring state management during rollback
   - **Exit Code Standards**: Use consistent exit codes (0=success, 1=failure, 2=warnings) for CI/CD integration
   - **Configuration Loading Order**: Local .env.local for dev → Environment variables → Hardcoded defaults for prod

5. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Added comprehensive Operations section to main documentation index
   - Linked all 6 operations guides with clear descriptions
   - Referenced all 6 verification scripts with one-line descriptions
   - Organized by operational concern (deployment, configuration, CI/CD)

**Knowledge Location:**
- **Primary KDD Document**: `docs/lessons-learned/deployment-operations-implementation-kdd.md` (comprehensive lessons learned)
- **Operations Guides**: `docs/operations/` (6 comprehensive operational procedures)
- **Verification Scripts**: `scripts/` (6 verification/validation scripts)
- **Documentation Index**: `docs/index.md` (Operations & Deployment section + Lessons Learned section)
- **Lessons Index**: `docs/lessons-learned/index.md` (Configuration & Environment section)
- **Story Record**: `docs/stories/8.4.story.md` (this file, transient reference only)

**Future Reference:**
- For deployment issues → `docs/operations/deployment-guide.md`
- For rollback procedures → `docs/operations/rollback-procedures.md`
- For configuration drift → `scripts/check-config-drift.sh`
- For health verification → `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` (all platforms) or `scripts/verify-worker-health.sh` (Worker-specific)
