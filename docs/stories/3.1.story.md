# Story 3.1: Metadata & Narrative Collection

## Story Overview
**Title**: Metadata & Narrative Collection  
**Epic**: Epic 3 - Incident Capture Workflow  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: Ready  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week  

## Story Statement

As a **frontline support worker**, I need to quickly capture essential incident metadata and detailed narrative descriptions across multiple phases, so that I can comprehensively document incidents while the details are fresh in my memory.

As a **disability care provider**, I need a structured incident reporting interface that guides me through capturing all required information, so that I can ensure compliance with NDIS reporting requirements without missing critical details.

## Business Context

Story 3.1 establishes the foundation of the incident capture workflow by implementing the first two critical steps: metadata collection and multi-phase narrative input. This story transforms the chaotic post-incident moment into a structured, guided process that ensures no critical information is lost.

**Key Business Drivers**:
- **Compliance Foundation**: Captures all required NDIS incident metadata fields
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Structured approach reduces mental burden during stressful post-incident reporting
- **Information Completeness**: Multi-phase narrative structure ensures comprehensive incident documentation
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback prevents incomplete submissions and reduces rework

This story enables frontline workers to move from chaotic, incomplete incident notes to structured, comprehensive incident documentation that forms the foundation for subsequent AI-powered analysis and enhancement.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 3.1.1: Incident Metadata Collection (Step 1)
**Given** I am an authenticated frontline worker starting an incident report  
**When** I navigate to the incident capture workflow  
**Then** I should see a metadata collection form that includes:
- **Reporter Name**: Pre-filled from authenticated user profile, editable for proxy reporting scenarios
- **Participant Selection**: Searchable dropdown of company's NDIS participants with auto-completion
- **Event Date/Time**: Date and time picker with current timezone, defaulting to current date/time
- **Location**: Text input field for incident location with suggestions for common company locations
- Form validation with clear success/error states for all fields
- Auto-save functionality that preserves entries as I type
- Progress indication showing this is Step 1 of 7

### AC 3.1.2: Multi-Phase Narrative Collection (Step 2)
**Given** I have completed the metadata collection step  
**When** I proceed to narrative collection  
**Then** I should see a 2x2 grid layout containing four narrative phases:
- **Before Event**: Large text area for describing conditions/context leading up to the incident
- **During Event**: Large text area for describing what happened during the incident
- **End Event**: Large text area for describing how the incident concluded or was resolved
- **Post-Event Support**: Large text area for describing immediate support provided after the incident
- Each text area should be clearly labeled and provide generous space for detailed descriptions
- Real-time character count and guidance on minimum content requirements
- Auto-save functionality for all narrative phases

### AC 3.1.3: Form Validation & User Guidance
**Given** I am completing the metadata and narrative forms  
**When** I interact with form fields and navigation  
**Then** the system should provide:
- Real-time validation with clear, actionable error messages
- Visual indicators (✓/❌) showing field completion status
- Requirement that at least one narrative phase contains meaningful content (minimum 50 characters)
- Disabled "Continue" button until minimum requirements are met
- Clear indication of which fields are required vs. optional
- Graceful error handling if auto-save fails, with retry mechanisms

### AC 3.1.4: Responsive Design & Mobile Optimization
**Given** I am using the incident capture workflow on various devices  
**When** I access the form on desktop, tablet, or mobile  
**Then** the interface should:
- Maintain full functionality across all screen sizes
- Use responsive 2x2 grid that adapts to single column on mobile devices
- Provide touch-friendly input elements on mobile devices
- Maintain readable text sizes and adequate touch targets
- Preserve auto-save functionality across all devices
- Handle virtual keyboard interactions without breaking layout

### AC 3.1.5: Progress Tracking & Navigation
**Given** I am working through the incident capture workflow  
**When** I need to understand my progress or navigate between steps  
**Then** I should see:
- Clear progress indicator showing "Step 1 of 7" and "Step 2 of 7"
- Breadcrumb navigation showing current position in workflow
- Ability to navigate back to Step 1 from Step 2 without losing data
- Visual confirmation when each step is completed successfully
- Clear "Continue to Next Step" button that's only enabled when requirements are met
