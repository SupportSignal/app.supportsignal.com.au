# Story 8.2: Environment-Aware URL Configuration System

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** all server functions to use environment-aware URL configuration instead of hardcoded localhost URLs,
**so that** production emails contain correct domain URLs and OAuth callbacks work properly in both environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create centralized configuration module for URL generation
2. Fix 7 server functions using wrong environment variables
3. Implement proper environment detection in Convex functions
4. Test email URLs in both environments
5. All hardcoded localhost URLs replaced with dynamic environment-aware configuration
6. Production emails contain `https://app.supportsignal.com.au` URLs
7. Development emails contain `http://localhost:3200` URLs
8. OAuth callbacks work correctly in both environments

## Estimation & Planning

### Story Points
**8**

### Estimated Complexity
**Medium-High**

### Estimated Time
**3-4 days**

### Risk Level

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 8.1 completion notes:
- **COMPLETE SEPARATION ACHIEVED**: All platforms configured with correct environment values
- **DEPLOYMENT METHODS DISCOVERED**: Convex Production via `bunx convex env set --prod`
- **KEY INSIGHT**: Environment separation requires coordinated updates across ALL platforms
- Production environment variables successfully set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://app.supportsignal.com.au`

### Critical Functions to Fix

**Development Environment Variables:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3200
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:beaming-gull-639
```

**Production Environment Variables:**
```

### Coding Standards Compliance
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Environment Access Requirements:**
- **No Direct process.env**: Direct access to `process.env` is banned
- **Configuration Pattern**: Use centralized configuration management
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All code must be fully type-safe
- **Correlation IDs**: All logs must include correlation ID for traceability

### File Locations
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Convex functions**: `apps/convex/` directory
- **Convex utilities**: `apps/convex/lib/` directory
- **Configuration modules**: `apps/convex/lib/environment.ts` (to be created)

### Pattern Validation

**Environment Configuration Pattern:**
- Create centralized configuration module following repository pattern
- Implement environment detection without direct `process.env` access
- Use TypeScript strict typing for all configuration objects
- Include correlation IDs in environment-related logging

**URL Generation Pattern:**
- Dynamic URL generation based on environment detection
- Proper fallback strategies for local development
- Consistent API for URL generation across all server functions

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: docs/testing/technical/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/convex/lib/` for configuration modules
- Integration tests: `tests/convex/integration/` for cross-function testing
- All tests centralized in `tests/` directory, not app directories

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test environment detection logic
- Test URL generation in both environments
- Test OAuth callback URL generation
- Test email URL generation
- Mock environment variables for testing different scenarios

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Centralized Jest configuration following established patterns
- Use `@ts-nocheck` pragmatically for TypeScript interface issues in tests
