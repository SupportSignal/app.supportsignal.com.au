# Story 8.1: Convex Environment Separation & Production Connection

## Status
**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Ready for Production Deployment & Testing

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to establish proper environment separation between development and production Convex deployments,
**so that** production and development systems have isolated databases and configuration, eliminating shared data issues and ensuring production reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Verify Production Deployment**: Confirm `graceful-shrimp-355` production deployment exists and is accessible via Convex dashboard and CLI
2. **Update Source-of-Truth Configuration**: Update `~/.env-configs/app.supportsignal.com.au.env` with correct production Convex deployment values (requires human)
3. **Regenerate Environment Files**: Use `bun run sync-env --deployment=production` to generate proper environment configuration
4. **Update Cloudflare Pages Environment**: Configure production environment variables to use `graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud` instead of shared `beaming-gull-639`
5. **Test Data Isolation**: Verify complete separation between dev and production databases with no shared data access
6. **Data Migration**: Migrate essential production data (companies, users, sessions) from shared deployment if needed
7. **Environment Validation**: Confirm both environments work independently with correct database access

## Estimation & Planning

### Story Points
**5**

### Estimated Complexity
**Medium-High**

### Estimated Time
**2-3 days**

### Risk Level
**High**

**Risk Factors:**
- Production data migration and potential data loss
- Production downtime during deployment switching
- Convex deployment access and permissions
- Environment variable coordination across multiple services

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Current Environment Problem:**
Both development (localhost:3200) and production (app.supportsignal.com.au) are using the same Convex deployment (`beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud`), causing:
- Shared database between environments
- Development data mixed with production data
- Risk of accidental production data corruption
- Configuration issues leading to localhost URLs in production

**Target Architecture:**
- **Development**: `dev:beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud` (current, keep as-is)
- **Production**: `prod:graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud` (target deployment)

**Deployment Information:**
- **Current MCP Status**: Only `ownDev:beaming-gull-639` visible in Convex MCP
- **Production Target**: `graceful-shrimp-355` deployment mentioned but needs verification
- **Access Requirements**: Convex dashboard and CLI access to both deployments

### Environment Management System Architecture

**Environment Configuration Flow**:
1. **Source-of-Truth** (human-managed): `~/.env-configs/app.supportsignal.com.au.env`
2. **Generated Files** (auto-generated): `.env.source-of-truth.local` via `bun run sync-env`
3. **Application Files** (auto-generated): `apps/web/.env.local`, `apps/convex/.env.local`

**Critical Issue Identified**:
The source-of-truth file currently has **identical dev and production values**:
```
| CONVEX | CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT | dev:beaming-gull-639 | dev:beaming-gull-639 |
| NEXTJS,CONVEX,GITHUB | NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL | https://beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud | https://beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud |
```

**Required Source-of-Truth Updates** (HUMAN REQUIRED):
```
| CONVEX | CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT | dev:beaming-gull-639 | prod:graceful-shrimp-355 |
| NEXTJS,CONVEX,GITHUB | NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL | https://beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud | https://graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud |
```

### **Complete sync-env.js Operations Guide**

**CORRECTED COMMANDS** (Updated Architecture):
```bash
# Test local environment generation (safe) - ALWAYS uses dev values
bun run sync-env:local --dry-run --verbose

# Test production deployment configuration (safe)
bun run sync-env:deploy-prod --dry-run --verbose

# Test development deployment configuration (safe)
bun run sync-env:deploy-dev --dry-run --verbose
```

**Environment Sync Process**:
```bash
# Local development (ALWAYS generates dev values only)
bun run sync-env:local

# Cloud deployment configurations
bun run sync-env:deploy-dev    # For dev deployment to cloud
bun run sync-env:deploy-prod   # For production deployment to cloud
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Automatic Backups**: Creates `~/.env-configs/backups/app.supportsignal.com.au/`
- ✅ **Safety**: `--dry-run` flag for testing without changes
- ✅ **Verbose Output**: `--verbose` flag for detailed process info
- ✅ **Multi-File Generation**: Creates web, convex, and worker .env files

**Manual Changes Required** (COMPLETED):

**File**: `~/.env-configs/app.supportsignal.com.au.env`

**✅ COMPLETED - Line 16**:
```
| CONVEX | CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT | dev:beaming-gull-639 | prod:graceful-shrimp-355 |
```

**✅ COMPLETED - Line 17**:
```
| NEXTJS,CONVEX,GITHUB | NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL | https://beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud | https://graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud |
```

**✅ COMPLETED - Line 23**:
```
| LOG_WORKER | ALLOWED_ORIGINS | https://beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud,http://localhost:3200 | https://graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud,https://app.supportsignal.com.au |
```

**✅ COMPLETED - Architecture Fix**: Updated sync-env.js to ensure local files NEVER contain production values

### Data Migration Strategy

**Essential Production Tables to Migrate:**
- `companies` - Production company data
- `users` - Production user accounts
- `sessions` - Active user sessions
- `password_reset_tokens` - Active password reset requests
- Critical incident data (if any exists in production)

**Migration Approach:**
1. **Assessment Phase**: Identify production vs development data in shared database
2. **Backup Phase**: Full backup of current shared database
3. **Migration Phase**: Export production data and import to `graceful-shrimp-355`
4. **Validation Phase**: Verify data integrity and functionality
5. **Cleanup Phase**: Remove production data from development deployment

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Convex Deployment Management:**
- Use `bunx convex env list` to verify available deployments
- Use `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=prod:graceful-shrimp-355` for production operations
- Verify schema deployment to production deployment
- Test function deployment and execution

**Environment Variable Update Process:**
1. **Cloudflare Pages Dashboard**: Update production environment variables
2. **Trigger Redeployment**: Force rebuild to pick up new environment variables
3. **Verification**: Test production site loads with new Convex connection
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for any connection errors or data access issues

### Pattern Validation

**Environment Separation Patterns:**
- Follow established multi-environment patterns from architecture documentation
- Ensure proper isolation between dev and production data
- Implement proper environment detection and configuration management
- Maintain separate deployment pipelines for each environment

**Data Migration Patterns:**
- Use established backup and migration procedures
- Implement data validation and integrity checks
- Document migration procedures for future reference
- Create rollback procedures for migration failures

## 🧪 COMPLETE TESTING GUIDE FOR ENVIRONMENT SEPARATION

### **STEP 1: Deploy Changes to Production**
```bash
# This triggers CI deployment with new environment variables
git add -A
git commit -m "Complete Convex environment separation

- Production Convex: graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud
- Development Convex: beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud
- All platforms updated with correct environment variables

🤖 Generated with Claude Code"
git push origin main
```

### **STEP 2: Monitor CI Deployment**
```bash
# Watch CI pipeline status
bun run ci:watch

# Check deployment logs if needed
bun run ci:logs
```

### **STEP 3: Test Development Environment** (Should use `beaming-gull-639`)
```bash
# Start local development
bun run dev

# Open browser: http://localhost:3200
# Test: Create incident, send email, check logs
# Verify: All data goes to development database
```

### **STEP 4: Test Production Environment** (Should use `graceful-shrimp-355`)
```bash
# After CI deployment completes:
# Open browser: https://app.supportsignal.com.au
# Test: Create incident, send email, check logs
# Verify: All data goes to production database
```

### **STEP 5: Verify Complete Separation**

**A) Check Email URLs:**
```bash
# Development emails should contain: http://localhost:3200
# Production emails should contain: https://app.supportsignal.com.au
```

**B) Database Isolation:**
- Development data appears ONLY in development
- Production data appears ONLY in production
- No cross-environment data leakage

**C) Environment Variables Check:**
```bash
# Development Convex
export CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:beaming-gull-639 && bunx convex data companies | head -3

# Production Convex
export CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=graceful-shrimp-355 && bunx convex data companies | head -3
```

### **STEP 6: Worker Separation Test**
```bash
# Test log ingestion worker accepts requests from both environments
curl -X POST https://supportsignal-log-ingestion-worker.david-0b1.workers.dev/health

# Should accept origins:
# - https://graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud (production)
# - http://localhost:3200 (development)
```

**✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [x] Production site uses `graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud`
- [x] Development site uses `beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud`
- [x] Email URLs match environment (localhost vs production)
- [x] Databases are completely isolated - **CONFIRMED: Different data in each environment**
- [x] Worker accepts requests from both environments
- [x] No cross-environment data access - **VERIFIED: Human testing confirmed separation**

### Testing Standards

**Test Requirements:**
- Manual testing for environment configuration and data isolation
- **Coverage**: Environment variable propagation, data isolation, authentication flows, email URLs
- **Validation**: Production and development environment complete independence

**Testing Patterns:**
- Test both environments independently after deployment
- Verify no cross-environment data access via direct database checks
- Test critical user flows in both environments (incident creation, email sending)
- Monitor for any environment configuration errors in browser console

**Testing Standards Reference:**
- Follow patterns established in `docs/testing/technical/testing-patterns.md`
- Use pragmatic testing approach for infrastructure changes
- Document environment testing procedures for future use
