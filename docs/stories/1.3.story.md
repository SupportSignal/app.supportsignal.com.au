# Story 1.3: User Authentication & Permissions

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** backend developer,  
**I want** to implement a secure authentication system with role-based access control supporting the distinct user types and their workflow permissions,  
**so that** the SupportSignal platform can provide secure access with appropriate permissions for Frontline Workers, Team Leaders, and Administrators according to their roles in the incident management workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [x] Enhanced Convex authentication with secure session management
2. [x] Role-based permission system for API endpoint protection
3. [x] User registration and invitation workflow for administrators
4. [x] Session persistence with workflow state recovery
5. [x] Password requirements and account security measures
6. [x] Audit logging for all authentication and authorization events

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md - Dev Agent Record]
- **Multi-tenant foundation**: Companies table and enhanced users with company_id established  
- **Users table structure**: Complete users table with role field and organizational attribution
- **Snake_case convention**: All database fields consistently use snake_case naming
- **Database indexes**: Optimized indexes for user queries and role-based filtering
- **Integration tests pattern**: 17/17 test success rate using centralized testing approach

[Source: docs/stories/1.2.story.md - Dev Agent Record]
- **AI service integration**: Comprehensive AI operations with authentication requirements
- **Correlation ID tracking**: All AI requests include correlation IDs for traceability
- **API authentication patterns**: OpenRouter and Anthropic API key authentication established
- **Error handling patterns**: Circuit breaker, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms

### Data Models & Schema Context
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
**Users Table Structure** (already established in Story 1.1):
```dbml
Table users {
  _id id [primary key]
  name string
  email string [unique, not null]
  profile_image_url string [note: 'Optional URL for user avatar']
  role string [not null, default: '"user"']
  _creationTime timestamp
}
```

**Required Permission Matrix** [Source: docs/prd/epic-1.md#story-13-requirements]:
| Action | Frontline Worker | Team Leader | Administrator |
|--------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Create Incident | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit Own Incident (capture phase) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| View Team Incidents | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Perform Analysis | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage Users | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| System Configuration | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Business Rule Clarification**: Team Leaders intentionally cannot edit their own incidents. This implements a **"democratic creation, controlled editing"** workflow where anyone can create incidents (democratic incident reporting), but once created, incidents become read-only to maintain data integrity. Only specific administrative roles can make modifications to preserve audit trail and prevent accidental changes.

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Authentication Technology**:
- **Convex**: 1.12.x - Real-time backend platform with native authentication support
- **Zod**: 3.23.x - Schema validation and type enforcement for user input validation
- **TypeScript**: 5.4.x - Type safety for authentication logic and permission definitions
- **Existing Auth System**: Current authentication components and patterns to be enhanced

### API Implementation Context
[Source: docs/architecture/api-implementation-details.md]
**Convex Function Signatures** (to be implemented):
- `users:getCurrentUser()`: `Query<UserProfile | null>` - Get current authenticated user
- `auth:registerUser(args: RegisterUserArgs)`: `Mutation<AuthResult>` - User registration
- `auth:loginUser(args: LoginArgs)`: `Mutation<AuthResult>` - User login
- `auth:logoutUser()`: `Mutation<void>` - User logout
- `auth:resetPassword(args: ResetPasswordArgs)`: `Action<void>` - Password reset workflow

### Security Requirements Context
[Source: docs/architecture/security.md]
**Multi-layered Security Strategy**:
- **Input Validation**: Zod for all authentication input validation
- **Session Management**: Enhanced Convex session handling with secure tokens
- **Secret Management**: Platform dashboard secret management (no hardcoded secrets)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive authentication and authorization event logging

### Architecture Patterns Context
[Source: docs/patterns/backend-patterns.md]
**Authentication & Authorization Patterns**:
- **Session Management**: Use Convex Auth for session handling, store user context in functions
- **Permission Checks**: Check user permissions early in functions, use consistent permission patterns
- **Error Handling**: Use ConvexError for user-facing authentication errors with proper error codes

### File Locations Context
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md + Previous Stories]
**Convex Directory Structure**:
- `apps/convex/schema.ts` - Database schema (users table already exists)
- `apps/convex/auth.ts` - Authentication functions (exists but needs enhancement)
- `apps/convex/users.ts` - User management functions (already exists)
- **New/Enhanced files to create**:
  - `apps/convex/auth.ts` - Enhanced authentication with secure session management
  - `apps/convex/permissions.ts` - Role-based permission system
  - `apps/convex/session-management.ts` - Session persistence and recovery

### Testing Standards Context
[Source: docs/testing/technical/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Testing Requirements**:
- **Test Location**: Create tests in `tests/convex/` directory (centralized testing pattern)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with Convex testing utilities  
- **Authentication Testing Approach**:
  - **Integration Tests**: Complete authentication workflows with ephemeral Convex environments
  - **Unit Tests**: Permission checking logic and authentication utilities
  - **Security Tests**: Permission boundary validation and unauthorized access scenarios
- **Required Tests**:
  - User registration and login workflows
  - Role-based permission enforcement
  - Session management and recovery
  - Security boundary and unauthorized access tests
  - Password security and validation tests

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **No Any Policy**: Use of `any` type prohibited in authentication code
- **No Direct process.env**: Use centralized configuration management for API keys and secrets
- **Repository Pattern**: All user data access must follow repository pattern
- **Correlation IDs**: All authentication requests must include correlation IDs for traceability
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All authentication code must be fully type-safe

### Pattern Validation
- Follow existing Convex patterns from current `apps/convex/` files
- Use consistent snake_case naming for new database fields
- Follow query/mutation pattern for data operations
- Use ConvexError for user-facing error messages with proper error codes
- Include correlation IDs for all authentication operations for audit trail
- Integrate with existing users table structure from Story 1.1

## Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/convex/` directory (centralized testing pattern)
**Testing Framework**: Jest with Convex testing utilities

**Required Test Coverage**:
- **Authentication Workflows**: Registration, login, logout, password reset
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control for all user types  
- **Session Management**: Session persistence, recovery, and expiration
- **Security Boundaries**: Unauthorized access prevention and proper error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Complete workflows with realistic user scenarios

**Testing Standards**:
- Use ephemeral Convex environments for integration tests
- Mock external dependencies but test real Convex operations
- Include error handling and edge case testing
- Validate audit logging for all authentication events
