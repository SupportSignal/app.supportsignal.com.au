# Story 2.4: Company Management

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** company administrator or system administrator,  
**I want** to view and manage my company's information and configuration settings,  
**So that** I can maintain accurate organizational data and configure default settings that affect participants, incidents, and overall system behavior within my company.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Company Details View**: Display current company information (name, contact_email, status) in readable format
2. **Edit Company Form**: Allow editing of company name, contact email, and status (active/trial/suspended)
3. **Navigation Integration**: Add to new "Company Administration" navigation group
4. **Admin Tools Access**: Maintain existing admin/company-settings route integration
5. **Role-Based Access**: Only company_admin and system_admin can access/edit
6. **Data Validation**: Proper validation for company information updates (email format, status values)
7. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly company management interface

## Estimation & Planning
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 1 week
- **Risk Level**: Medium

### Risk Factors
- Navigation restructuring affects existing participants navigation
- Integration with existing admin/company-settings route requires careful routing
- Form validation for company settings needs comprehensive rules
- Role-based access control must align with existing authentication patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Schema Cleanup** (Schema maintenance)
  - [ ] Remove unused `slug` field from companies table schema
  - [ ] Update any existing companies records to remove slug field
  - [ ] Verify schema migration doesn't break existing functionality
  - [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces to match cleaned schema

- [ ] **Navigation Structure Update** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create "Company Administration" navigation group in navigation-config.ts
  - [ ] Move participants menu item from "Workflows" to "Company Administration"
  - [ ] Add "Company Management" menu item with proper role restrictions
  - [ ] Test navigation group displays correctly for different user roles

- [ ] **Company Management Page Implementation** (AC: 1, 2, 7)
  - [ ] Create /company-management route and page component
  - [ ] Build company information display component with current data (name, contact_email, status)
  - [ ] Implement edit form with company fields (name, contact_email, status)
  - [ ] Add responsive design for mobile and tablet compatibility

- [ ] **Backend Company Management Functions** (AC: 2, 6)
  - [ ] Create Convex function to get current user's company details
  - [ ] Implement company update mutation with role-based validation
  - [ ] Add field validation (email format, status enum values)
  - [ ] Implement audit trail for company changes and slug removal

- [ ] **Admin Route Integration** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Update existing /admin/company-settings page to reference new component
  - [ ] Ensure shared component works from both routes
  - [ ] Test navigation between admin tools and main company management
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing admin workflow

- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement role checks for company_admin and system_admin only
  - [ ] Add permission validation in both frontend and backend
  - [ ] Test access control for different user roles
  - [ ] Ensure proper error messages for unauthorized access

## Documentation Impact Assessment
- **Navigation Patterns**: Establishes "Company Administration" navigation group pattern that may be reused for other admin-focused features
- **Admin Route Integration**: Creates pattern for dual-access routes (main navigation + admin tools) that could apply to other management features
- **Company Management Patterns**: Establishes patterns for multi-tenant company configuration that will inform future organizational features
- **Role-Based Form Patterns**: Creates reusable patterns for role-restricted editing forms

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.3 Dev Agent Record]
- **Multi-Tenant Patterns**: Story 2.3 established robust company-scoped data isolation patterns using company_id indexes
- **Role-Based Access**: Proven patterns for restricting access to team_lead, company_admin, and system_admin roles
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive client-side and server-side validation patterns established
- **Component Architecture**: Five-component pattern (Form, List, Card, Search, Selector) works well for entity management
- **Navigation Integration**: Navigation updates require careful testing across user roles

### Data Models
[Source: apps/convex/schema.ts lines 12-21 - actual companies table]
**Existing Companies Table Structure**:
```typescript
// Already exists from Epic 1 - current schema
interface Company {
  _id: Id<"companies">;
  name: string; // "Support Signal", "ABC NDIS Provider"
  slug: string; // URL-friendly identifier (TO BE REMOVED)
  contact_email: string; // Primary contact
  status: "active" | "trial" | "suspended";
  created_at: number;
  created_by?: Id<"users">; // Temporarily optional for seed data
  _creationTime: number;
}
```

**Company Management Interface** (works with actual schema):
```typescript
interface CompanyManagement {
  // Core company data (from actual companies table)
  _id: Id<"companies">;
  name: string;
  contact_email: string;
  status: "active" | "trial" | "suspended";
  created_at: number;
  created_by?: Id<"users">;
  
  // Management-specific computed fields
  canEdit: boolean; // Based on user role
  lastUpdated: number;
  updatedBy: Id<"users">;
}
```

**Schema Changes Required**:
- Remove `slug` field (unused for company management)
- Focus on `name`, `contact_email`, `status` as editable fields

### Component Specifications

### API Specifications
[Source: Epic 1 authentication patterns, Story 2.3 CRUD patterns, apps/convex/schema.ts]
**Convex Functions Required**:
```typescript
// companies/getCompany.ts
export const getCompany = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const currentUser = await getCurrentUser(ctx);
    if (!canManageCompany(currentUser.role)) {
      throw new ConvexError("Insufficient permissions");
    }
    
    return await ctx.db.get(currentUser.company_id);
  },
});

// companies/updateCompany.ts
export const updateCompany = mutation({
  args: {
    name: v.string(),
    contact_email: v.string(),
    status: v.union(v.literal("active"), v.literal("trial"), v.literal("suspended")),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const currentUser = await getCurrentUser(ctx);
    if (!canManageCompany(currentUser.role)) {
      throw new ConvexError("Insufficient permissions");
    }
    
    // Remove slug field during update
    const currentCompany = await ctx.db.get(currentUser.company_id);
    if (!currentCompany) {
      throw new ConvexError("Company not found");
    }
    
    return await ctx.db.patch(currentUser.company_id, {
      name: args.name,
      contact_email: args.contact_email,
      status: args.status,
      // Remove slug field as part of schema cleanup
      slug: undefined,
    });
  },
});

// Role validation function
const canManageCompany = (userRole: UserRole): boolean => {
  return ["system_admin", "company_admin"].includes(userRole);
};
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types allowed
- **Next.js**: App Router patterns, server/client components
- **ShadCN UI**: Use established form and display components
- **Convex**: Real-time mutations with proper error handling
- **Role-Based Access**: Follow existing authentication patterns
- **Multi-Tenant**: All operations scoped by user's company_id

## Pattern Validation
[Source: docs/patterns/frontend-patterns.md, docs/patterns/backend-patterns.md]
**Must Follow Established Patterns**:
- **Multi-Tenant Data Access**: All company operations must be scoped by user's company_id (from Story 2.3)
- **Role-Based Components**: Use existing role validation patterns for UI access control
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation patterns from ShadCN forms
- **Navigation Structure**: Follow existing navigation group patterns and role-based visibility
- **Error Handling**: Use ConvexError for backend validation, proper error UI components

**New Patterns to Establish**:
- **Dual-Route Access**: Pattern for components accessible from both main nav and admin tools
- **Company Configuration**: Patterns for managing organization-wide settings
- **Administrative Navigation Groups**: "Company Administration" as template for other admin groupings

## Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Test Location**: `tests/web/components/company/` (centralized testing pattern)
**Testing Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
**Required Test Coverage**:
- **Component Tests**: CompanyDetailsView and CompanyEditForm functionality
- **Role-Based Access**: Permission enforcement for different user roles
- **Form Validation**: Company information validation and error handling
- **Navigation Tests**: Company Administration group visibility and navigation
- **Integration Tests**: Convex function testing with company data
- **Dual-Route Access**: Both main nav and admin tools access working correctly

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-08-09 | 1.0 | Initial story creation for company management system - extends Epic 2 entity management with organizational administration capabilities | Bob (sm agent) |
| 2025-08-09 | 1.1 | CRITICAL: Updated to match actual companies schema - removed non-existent domain/settings fields, added slug removal task, focused on real fields: name, contact_email, status | Bob (sm agent) |

## Security Considerations

### Access Control Security
- **Role-Based Restrictions**: Only company_admin and system_admin can access company management
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Users can only manage their own company data (company_id scoping)
- **Permission Validation**: Both frontend and backend validation for unauthorized access attempts
- **Audit Trail**: All company changes logged with user identification and timestamps

### Data Validation Security
- **Email Validation**: Contact email must pass format validation and sanitization
- **Status Enum Validation**: Company status restricted to predefined values only
- **Input Sanitization**: All company name and contact fields sanitized against injection attacks
- **Schema Cleanup**: Removal of unused slug field reduces attack surface

## Performance Considerations

### Database Performance
- **Indexed Queries**: Company lookups use existing company_id indexes for fast retrieval
- **Single Company Scope**: Operations limited to user's company reduces query scope
- **Schema Optimization**: Slug field removal reduces storage overhead and query complexity

### Frontend Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Company management components loaded on-demand
- **Form Debouncing**: Input validation with appropriate debouncing to prevent excessive API calls
- **Caching**: Company data cached appropriately to reduce redundant database queries

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Requirements
- [ ] **Schema Migration**: Verify slug field removal doesn't break existing functionality
- [ ] **Role Permissions**: Confirm company_admin and system_admin roles have proper access
- [ ] **Navigation Testing**: Test Company Administration group displays correctly
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing /admin/company-settings route continues working

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] **Access Control Testing**: Verify unauthorized users cannot access company management
- [ ] **Form Validation**: Test all company field validation rules work correctly
- [ ] **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Confirm companies can only see/edit their own data
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Verify company changes are properly logged with user context

## Integration Patterns Established

### Navigation Group Pattern
- **Company Administration Group**: Template for other administrative navigation groupings
- **Role-Based Visibility**: Navigation items conditionally displayed based on user permissions
- **Icon and Label Standards**: Consistent iconography and naming conventions

### Dual-Route Access Pattern
- **Main Navigation Access**: `/company-management` route from primary navigation
- **Admin Tools Access**: Integration with existing `/admin/company-settings` workflow
- **Shared Components**: Components designed for use from multiple entry points
- **Route Consistency**: URL patterns align with existing admin tool conventions
