# Story 8.3: OAuth Production Application Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** separate OAuth applications for production environment with correct callback URLs,
**so that** authentication flows work correctly in both development and production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create production GitHub OAuth app with correct callback URLs
2. Create production Google OAuth app with correct callback URLs
3. Update production environment variables with new OAuth credentials
4. Test authentication flows in both environments

## Estimation & Planning

### Story Points
**5**

### Estimated Complexity
**Medium**

### Estimated Time
**1-2 days**

### Risk Level
**Medium**

**Risk Factors:**
- OAuth configuration changes require careful testing
- Production authentication interruption during transition
- OAuth provider app approval processes may introduce delays
- Coordination between environment variables and OAuth app settings

## Documentation Impact Assessment

**Architectural Patterns Established:**
- Production OAuth application setup pattern
- Environment-specific authentication configuration
- OAuth provider management across environments

**Documentation Updates Needed:**
- Update authentication architecture documentation with production OAuth setup
- Create OAuth application management procedures documentation
- Document environment-specific authentication configuration patterns

**Knowledge Capture:**
- OAuth application setup procedures for different environments
- Production authentication configuration best practices
- OAuth provider-specific configuration requirements

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 8.2 completion notes:
- **CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION CREATED**: `apps/convex/lib/urlConfig.ts` module provides environment-aware URL generation
- **ALL HARDCODED URLS REPLACED**: email.ts, auth.ts, and workerSync.ts now use centralized configuration
- **ENVIRONMENT DETECTION**: Robust environment detection with fallbacks for development, production, and test
- **URL GENERATION SECURITY**: Comprehensive URL validation using native URL constructor

### OAuth Configuration Requirements
[Source: Epic 8 Technical Requirements]

**Development OAuth Apps:**
- GitHub callback: `http://localhost:3200/auth/github/callback`
- Google callback: `http://localhost:3200/auth/google/callback`

**Production OAuth Apps (to be created):**
- GitHub callback: `https://app.supportsignal.com.au/auth/github/callback`
- Google callback: `https://app.supportsignal.com.au/auth/google/callback`

### Authentication System Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/security.md]

**BetterAuth Integration**:
- Authentication service with first-party Convex adapter
- Session management through Convex
- OAuth integration through BetterAuth OAuth providers

**File Locations**:
- Authentication functions: `apps/convex/auth.ts`
- Configuration utilities: `apps/convex/lib/urlConfig.ts` (from Story 8.2)

### Environment Management System
[Source: Epic 8 Environment Management System Operations]

**Environment Variable Deployment**:
- Use `bun run sync-env:deploy-prod` for production deployment (currently blocked for security)
- Alternative: Manual environment variable configuration through Convex dashboard
- Local files always contain development values only

**Critical Architecture Principle**:
- **Local `.env.local` files NEVER contain production values**
- Production values deployed directly to cloud platforms

### Coding Standards Compliance
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Environment Access Requirements:**
- **No Direct process.env**: Must use centralized configuration from Story 8.2
- **Configuration Pattern**: Use `apps/convex/lib/urlConfig.ts` for URL generation
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All code must be fully type-safe
- **Correlation IDs**: All logs must include correlation ID for traceability

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/testing/technical/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- All tests centralized in `tests/` directory, not app directories
- OAuth-related tests: `tests/convex/auth/` for authentication testing
- Integration tests: `tests/convex/integration/` for full workflow testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Comprehensive testing of OAuth callback flows
- Mock OAuth responses for testing different scenarios
- Test environment detection in authentication flows

**Authentication Testing Requirements:**
- Test OAuth callback URL generation in both environments
- Test authentication workflow with production OAuth applications
- Test session management with environment-specific configuration
- Validate callback URL format and environment detection

### Pattern Validation

**Environment Configuration Pattern:**
[Source: Story 8.2 KDD Knowledge Capture]
- Use centralized `apps/convex/lib/urlConfig.ts` for all URL generation
- Environment detection without direct `process.env` access
- Callback URL generation using `generateOAuthCallbackUrl()` function
- Environment-aware validation with fallbacks

**OAuth Integration Pattern:**
- BetterAuth OAuth provider configuration follows established patterns
- Environment-specific OAuth application separation
- Secure credential management through environment variables
- Comprehensive testing across both environments

### Current OAuth Configuration Status
[Source: Epic 8 Technical Requirements - OAuth Configuration Requirements]

**Development OAuth Applications:**
- GitHub: Currently configured with localhost callbacks
- Google: Currently configured with localhost callbacks

**Production OAuth Applications:**
- GitHub: **NEEDS CREATION** - New application required for production domain
- Google: **NEEDS CREATION** - New application required for production domain

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Story 8.2 `urlConfig.ts` module provides callback URL generation
- Environment management system provides credential deployment
- BetterAuth configuration in `apps/convex/auth.ts` handles OAuth integration

## Testing

### Test Strategy
[Source: docs/testing/technical/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**OAuth Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for OAuth callback URL generation
- Integration tests for complete authentication workflows
- Environment-specific testing for both dev and production
- Mock OAuth provider responses for automated testing

**Test Locations:**
- OAuth utility tests: `tests/convex/lib/` directory
- Authentication integration tests: `tests/convex/integration/` directory
- End-to-end authentication tests: `tests/e2e/` directory

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Playwright for end-to-end authentication flow testing
- Mock OAuth providers for testing without external dependencies
