# Story 4.2: Workflow Continuation System

## Story Details

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Epic**: Epic 4: Incident Management & Listing  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days  
**Status**: COMPLETED

## User Story

As a **user with incident creation permissions**, when I visit the new incident page, I want to see my incomplete incidents and choose to continue existing work or start fresh, so that I don't create duplicate incidents or lose progress on partially completed work.

## Business Value

Prevents workflow abandonment and duplicate incident creation while providing seamless workflow continuation.

**Impact**:
- Reduces duplicate incident creation by providing clear workflow continuation options
- Improves user efficiency by eliminating time lost searching for incomplete work
- Decreases workflow abandonment by making incomplete incidents easily discoverable
- Enhances user experience by providing intelligent workflow guidance

## Technical Foundation

Building on Story 4.1's incident listing foundation:
- Leverages `getMyIncompleteIncidents()` query for personal incident discovery
- Extends existing `/new-incident` route with conditional modal logic
- Reuses incident status tracking from foundational listing system
- Integrates with existing workflow routing and state management

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Conditional Modal Display Logic
**Requirements**:
- Modal triggered **ONLY** when user has incomplete incidents
- If no incomplete incidents exist → Direct to new incident creation (no modal)
- If incomplete incidents exist → Show "Continue Existing" vs "Start New Incident" modal
- Improves UX by eliminating unnecessary modal interruption

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Query incomplete incidents on page load
const incompleteIncidents = useQuery(api.incidents.getMyIncompleteIncidents);

// Conditional modal rendering logic
const shouldShowModal = incompleteIncidents && incompleteIncidents.length > 0;
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [x] Modal only appears when user has incomplete incidents
- [x] No modal shown when user has no incomplete incidents
- [x] Direct navigation to incident creation when no incomplete incidents
- [x] Modal renders within 1 second of page load

### AC2: Personal Incident Preview
**Requirements**:
- Incident summary cards showing: Participant, Date Started, Current Step
- Progress indicator (e.g., "Step 3 of 7 - During Event Narrative")
- Last modified timestamp for context
- Quick preview of incident content (first 100 characters)

**UI Specifications**:
```typescript
interface IncidentPreviewCard {
  participant: string;
  dateStarted: string;
  currentStep: number;
  stepDescription: string;
  lastModified: string;
  contentPreview: string; // First 100 characters
  progressPercentage: number;
}
```

**Visual Requirements**:
- Card-based layout showing maximum 3-4 incomplete incidents
- Progress bars showing completion percentage
- Clear visual hierarchy with participant name as primary identifier
- Mobile-responsive design for all users

**Validation Criteria**:
- [x] All required fields displayed correctly in preview cards
- [x] Progress indicators accurately reflect current workflow step
- [x] Content preview shows meaningful incident context
- [x] Last modified timestamp provides temporal context

### AC3: Seamless Workflow Integration
**Requirements**:
- "Continue" button resumes exact workflow step where user left off
- "Start New" proceeds to fresh incident creation
- "Maybe Later" option closes modal and allows normal navigation

**Routing Logic**:
```typescript
// Continue existing incident
router.push(`/new-incident?id=${incidentId}&step=${currentStep}`);

// Start new incident
router.push('/new-incident');
```

**State Management**:
- Preserve existing incident state when continuing
- Clear form state when starting new incident
- Handle modal dismissal without affecting navigation

**Validation Criteria**:
- [x] Continue button resumes at exact workflow step
- [x] Start New creates fresh incident with clean form state
- [x] Maybe Later closes modal and allows normal page navigation

### AC4: Performance and UX
**Requirements**:
- Modal loads quickly (<1 second) with minimal data
- Mobile-responsive design for all users
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter to continue, Esc to close)

   export const getMyIncompleteIncidents = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       const { user } = await requirePermission(ctx, args.sessionToken, PERMISSIONS.VIEW_MY_INCIDENTS);
       
       return await ctx.db
         .query("incidents")
         .withIndex("by_user_company", (q) =>
           q.eq("userId", user._id).eq("companyId", user.companyId)
         )
         .filter((q) => 
           q.or(
             q.eq(q.field("status"), "draft"),
             q.eq(q.field("status"), "capture_pending")
           )
         )
         .order("desc")
         .take(10); // Limit to recent incomplete incidents
     },
   });
   ```

2. **Add current step tracking to incident schema**:
   ```typescript
   // convex/schema.ts - extend incident table
   currentStep: v.optional(v.number()), // 1-7 for workflow steps
   stepDescription: v.optional(v.string()), // Human readable step name
   contentPreview: v.optional(v.string()), // First 100 chars for preview
   ```

3. **Create workflow step resolution helper**:
   ```typescript
   // convex/incidents.ts
   export const getWorkflowStepInfo = (step: number) => {
     const stepMap = {
       1: "Basic Information",
       2: "Before Event",
       3: "During Event", 
       4: "After Event",
       5: "Q&A Session",
       6: "AI Enhancement",
       7: "Review & Submit"
     };
     return stepMap[step] || "Unknown Step";
   };
   ```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] `getMyIncompleteIncidents` query returns user's incomplete incidents only
- [x] Company-scoped data filtering enforced (no cross-company data)
- [x] Current step and progress information included in response
- [x] Query performance optimized for mobile usage (<1 second)

### Task 4.2.2: Continue Workflow Modal Component

   interface ContinueWorkflowModalProps {
     isOpen: boolean;
     onClose: () => void;
     incompleteIncidents: IncidentPreview[];
     onContinue: (incidentId: string) => void;
     onStartNew: () => void;
   }
   ```

2. **Build incident preview cards**:
   ```typescript
   // components/incidents/IncidentPreviewCard.tsx
   interface IncidentPreviewCardProps {
     participant: string;
     dateStarted: Date;
     currentStep: number;
     lastModified: Date;
     contentPreview: string;
     onContinue: () => void;
   }
   ```

3. **Implement progress indicators**:

### Task 4.2.3: New Incident Page Integration
**Objective**: Integrate the continue workflow modal into the existing new incident page

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Update `/new-incident` page with modal logic**:
   ```typescript
   // app/new-incident/page.tsx
   const incompleteIncidents = useQuery(api.incidents.getMyIncompleteIncidents);
   const shouldShowModal = incompleteIncidents?.length > 0;
   ```

2. **Add URL parameter handling**:
   ```typescript
   // Handle ?id=incident_id&step=X parameters for continuation
   const searchParams = useSearchParams();
   const continueIncidentId = searchParams.get('id');
   const continueStep = searchParams.get('step');
   ```

3. **Implement routing logic**:
   - Continue button: Navigate with incident ID and step parameters
   - Start New: Navigate to clean incident form
   - Maybe Later: Close modal, stay on current page

4. **Add state management for modal**:
   - Track modal open/closed state
   - Handle modal dismissal
   - Preserve navigation context

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Modal automatically appears when appropriate (incomplete incidents exist)
- [x] URL parameters for incident continuation work correctly
- [x] Navigation routing works for all modal actions
- [x] No modal shown when no incomplete incidents

### Task 4.2.4: Workflow State Continuation
**Objective**: Enable seamless continuation of incomplete incident workflows

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Extend incident form to load existing data**:
   ```typescript
   // Load existing incident data when continuing
   const existingIncident = useQuery(api.incidents.getIncident, 
     continueIncidentId ? { id: continueIncidentId } : "skip"
   );
   ```

2. **Implement step-specific form population**:
   - Pre-populate form fields with existing incident data
   - Set correct step in workflow progression
   - Handle partial data gracefully

3. **Add form state management**:
   - Differentiate between new and continued incidents
   - Handle form validation for partially complete data
   - Preserve unsaved changes during continuation

4. **Implement progress tracking**:
   - Update incident's current step as user progresses
   - Track completion percentage
   - Update last modified timestamp

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Existing incident data loads correctly when continuing
- [x] Form pre-populates with saved information
- [x] Workflow resumes at correct step
- [x] Progress tracking updates as user continues
- [x] Form validation handles partial data appropriately

### Data Privacy
- **Content Preview Limitation**: Limit preview content to non-sensitive information (first 100 characters)
- **Session Management**: Secure handling of incident ID parameters in URLs
- **Data Minimization**: Only fetch necessary data for modal display

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
- **Modal Performance**: Complex modal with multiple incident cards may load slowly
  - *Mitigation*: Limit to 10 most recent incidents, implement lazy loading
- **State Management Complexity**: Managing modal state alongside form state
  - *Mitigation*: Use clear state separation and well-defined interfaces

### User Experience Risks
- **Modal Interruption Fatigue**: Users may find modal disruptive to workflow
  - *Mitigation*: Only show modal when incomplete incidents exist, provide "Maybe Later" option
- **Mobile Usability**: Modal may be difficult to use on small screens
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive mobile testing and touch-optimized design

### Business Risks
- **Workflow Disruption**: Changes to familiar `/new-incident` flow
  - *Mitigation*: Phased rollout with user training and feedback collection
- **Decreased New Incident Creation**: Users may always continue instead of starting fresh
  - *Mitigation*: Monitor metrics and ensure "Start New" option is prominent and easy to use

## Success Metrics

### User Adoption
- **Workflow Continuation Rate**: >60% of incomplete incidents resumed vs. abandoned
- **Modal Usage**: >80% of users with incomplete incidents use continue functionality
- **User Satisfaction**: Modal rated >4/5 for helpfulness across all user roles

### Performance Metrics
- **Modal Load Time**: <1 second from page load to interactive modal
