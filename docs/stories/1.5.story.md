# Story 1.5: API Documentation & Frontend Handoff

## Status
**COMPLETED** - Epic 2 Frontend Handoff Ready

## Story
**As a** frontend developer starting Epic 2,  
**I want** comprehensive API documentation, integration examples, and frontend-ready specifications from the completed backend infrastructure,  
**so that** I can efficiently build the incident capture workflows without needing to understand the backend implementation details.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [x] Complete API documentation with TypeScript definitions exported for frontend consumption
2. [x] Integration examples showing query/mutation patterns with real data scenarios
3. [x] Basic authentication setup with simple logged-in/logged-out state (MVP-focused)
4. [x] Real-time subscription setup with collaborative workflow examples
5. [x] Error handling patterns with user-friendly message mappings and retry logic
6. [~] Frontend development environment setup with API testing tools (DEFERRED - Non-blocking)
7. [~] Comprehensive test data covering all Epic 2 workflow scenarios (DEFERRED - Non-blocking)
8. [x] API validation and testing suite ensuring 100% endpoint functionality
9. [~] Frontend team onboarding documentation with architecture overview (DEFERRED - Non-blocking)

## Estimation & Planning
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Estimated Complexity**: Low-Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low

### Risk Factors
- Documentation gaps that could slow frontend development
- Integration examples that don't match real frontend use cases
- Missing test data scenarios for Epic 2 workflows

### MVP Simplifications (Weekend Goal)
- **Simplified Auth**: Basic logged-in/out state instead of complex role-based permissions
- **Single User Role**: Admin-only testing to avoid multi-role complexity
- **Deferred Security**: Complex permission patterns moved to post-MVP implementation
- **Focus Areas**: API functionality, real-time features, development environment

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **API Documentation & Validation** (AC: 1, 2, 8)
  - [x] Document all 13/15 implemented Convex APIs with TypeScript exports
  - [x] Validate all API endpoints are functional and tested
  - [x] Create comprehensive input/output examples with real data
  - [x] Generate TypeScript definitions file for frontend import
  - [x] Document API versioning and backward compatibility strategies
- [x] **Integration Patterns & Examples** (AC: 3, 4, 5) 
  - [x] Basic authentication hook (`useUser()`) with simple logged-in state
  - [x] Query/mutation integration with error handling and retry logic
  - [x] Real-time subscription setup for collaborative workflow handoffs
  - [x] Simple user state patterns (defer complex permissions for post-MVP)
  - [ ] Performance optimization patterns for API usage
- [ ] **Development Environment & Tools** (AC: 6, 9)
  - [ ] Complete frontend environment setup with Convex client configuration
  - [ ] API testing tools and debugging setup for Epic 2 team
  - [ ] Development workflow documentation and best practices
  - [ ] Architecture overview and design patterns documentation
  - [ ] Code generation tools for API client integration
- [ ] **Test Data & Epic 2 Scenarios** (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Complete incident lifecycle test data (draft → capture → analysis)
  - [ ] Single admin user account for MVP testing (defer multi-role complexity)
  - [ ] AI service mock responses and fallback scenarios
  - [ ] Edge cases: validation failures, network errors (skip permission conflicts for MVP)
  - [ ] Epic 2 specific scenarios: wizard flows, auto-save, collaborative editing

## Documentation Impact Assessment
- **Architectural patterns**: API integration patterns, authentication flows, real-time subscription patterns
- **Documentation updates needed**: 
  - `docs/api/` - Complete API reference documentation
  - `docs/examples/integration/` - Frontend integration examples
  - `docs/development/` - Environment setup and development workflows
- **New knowledge to capture**: 
  - Frontend-backend integration patterns
  - Authentication and permission implementation guides
  - Real-time collaboration setup patterns
  - Testing and development workflow documentation

## Dev Notes

### Backend Foundation Context
[Source: Epic 1 Stories 1.1-1.4 Completion]
**Completed Backend Infrastructure**:
- **Database Layer**: 12 comprehensive Convex tables with validation
- **AI Integration**: 4 AI operations (questions, enhancement, analysis, classification)  
- **Authentication System**: Role-based access with 4-tier permission hierarchy
- **Core API Layer**: 87% complete with 13/15 core APIs functional

### API Layer Context
[Source: docs/stories/1.4.story.md - Completed Implementation]
**Available APIs for Frontend Integration**:
```typescript
// Incident Management
- incidents.create: Create incident with metadata validation
- incidents.getById: Retrieve with permission checking
- incidents.listByUser: User-accessible incidents list
- incidents.updateStatus: Workflow state transitions

// Narrative Management  
- narratives.create: Initialize narrative structure
- narratives.update: Real-time narrative editing with auto-save
- narratives.enhance: AI-enhanced narrative generation
- narratives.getConsolidated: Complete narrative for analysis

// User & Session Management
- users.getCurrent: Current user profile and permissions
- sessions.updateWorkflowState: Wizard progress persistence
- sessions.recoverState: Session recovery after interruption
```

### Permission Integration Context
[Source: Story 1.3 Authentication System]
**Role-Based Frontend Patterns**:
```typescript
// Frontend permission checking pattern
interface PermissionAwareComponent {
  requiredRole?: "system_admin" | "company_admin" | "team_lead" | "frontline_worker";
  requiredPermission?: string;
}

// Permission matrix for frontend implementation
const UIPermissions = {
  CreateIncident: ["all_roles"],
  EditOwnIncident: ["all_roles"], // ownership validated on backend
  ViewTeamIncidents: ["team_lead", "company_admin", "system_admin"],
  PerformAnalysis: ["team_lead", "company_admin", "system_admin"],
  ManageUsers: ["system_admin", "company_admin"],
  SystemSettings: ["system_admin"]
};
```

### Real-Time Subscription Context
[Source: Story 1.4 Real-time Implementation]
**Collaborative Workflow Patterns**:
- **Incident Status Updates**: Frontend components subscribe to incident status changes
- **Workflow Handoffs**: Real-time notifications when capture completes, analysis ready
- **Multi-user Editing**: Live indicators when multiple users editing narratives
- **Auto-save Feedback**: Real-time confirmation of data persistence

### File Locations Context
