# Story 2.1: Wizard Framework & Navigation

## Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - 2025-08-08

## Story
**As a** frontend developer,  
**I want** to build a reusable wizard component framework that provides consistent navigation, progress tracking, and validation patterns,  
**so that** the 7-step incident capture workflow can be implemented with robust state persistence, validation, and accessibility compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [x] Reusable `WizardShell` component with configurable steps and validation
2. [x] Progress indicator showing 7 steps with clear visual state (pending/current/completed)
3. [x] Navigation controls that respect validation rules and user permissions
4. [x] Auto-save functionality with 300ms debouncing for all form inputs
5. [x] Session recovery that restores user to exact step and input state
6. [x] Mobile-responsive design tested on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
7. [x] Keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility compliance

## Estimation & Planning
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Estimated Time**: 1 week

  - Mobile wizard navigation patterns
  - Accessibility patterns for complex navigation flows

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[Source: docs/stories/2.0.story.md - Final Completion Summary]
- **20 Healthcare Components**: Complete component library with WorkflowWizard foundation component available
- **Design System**: Full SupportSignal brand integration with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Component Specifications**: Complete design system documentation including WorkflowWizard patterns
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing patterns and accessibility compliance established

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
**UI Technologies for Wizard Framework Implementation**:
- **Next.js**: 14.2.x - App Router with Server/Client Component patterns
- **TypeScript**: 5.4.x - Type safety for wizard state and validation interfaces
- **ShadCN/UI & Tailwind**: Latest - Accessible component library foundation and utility-first CSS
- **Zustand**: 4.5.x - Client state management for wizard state and persistence
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with Zod validation integration
- **Storybook**: 8.1.x - UI component workshop for isolated wizard development

### Data Models Context
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
**Wizard State Management Data Structures**:
```typescript
// Wizard configuration interface
interface WizardStep {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  component: React.ComponentType<WizardStepProps>;
  validator: (data: any) => ValidationResult;
  required: boolean;
}

interface WizardConfig {
  steps: WizardStep[];
  onComplete: (data: any) => Promise<void>;
  autoSave: boolean;
  allowBackNavigation: boolean;
}

// Session persistence structure
interface WizardSession {
  wizardId: string;
  currentStep: number;
  stepData: Record<string, any>;
  lastSaved: timestamp;
  completedSteps: string[];
}
```

### Component Specifications Context
[Source: docs/design-system/component-specifications.md]
**WorkflowWizard Foundation Available**:
- Existing `WorkflowWizard` component in `apps/web/components/user/workflow-wizard.tsx` provides base patterns
- Component already implements healthcare use cases and accessibility standards
- New `WizardShell` should be more generic and reusable framework component
- Should integrate with existing SupportSignal design system (teal gradient, navy text, proper spacing)

### File Locations Context
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
**Wizard Component Implementation Locations**:
- `apps/web/components/workflow/wizard-shell.tsx` - Main WizardShell framework component
- `apps/web/components/workflow/wizard-types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `apps/web/components/workflow/wizard-persistence.ts` - Session storage and recovery utilities
- `apps/web/lib/wizard/` - Wizard framework utilities and helpers
- `packages/ui/src/` - Reusable wizard UI components if needed for cross-project use

### Technical Constraints Context
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Mandatory Implementation Requirements**:
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All wizard interfaces must be fully type-safe with no `any` types
- **No process.env Access**: Use centralized configuration management for environment variables
- **Repository Pattern**: If wizard needs data persistence, must follow repository pattern abstraction
- **Correlation IDs**: All wizard actions must include correlation IDs for logging and traceability

### Frontend Patterns Context
[Source: docs/patterns/frontend-patterns.md]
**Established Component Patterns to Follow**:
- **Server-First Components**: WizardShell should be client component (`"use client"`) due to interactivity requirements
- **Tailwind-First Styling**: Use Tailwind utilities with ShadCN UI theming patterns
- **Client Component Boundaries**: Wizard requires useState, useEffect, and browser APIs for persistence

### Testing Requirements Context
[Source: docs/testing/technical/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Test Location**: `tests/web/components/workflow/` directory (centralized testing pattern)
**Required Test Coverage**:
- **Component Rendering**: WizardShell renders correctly with various step configurations
- **Navigation Logic**: Step progression, validation enforcement, back navigation
- **State Persistence**: Auto-save functionality, session recovery, data integrity
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile compatibility testing across iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- **User Interactions**: Button clicks, form inputs, validation feedback

## Pattern Validation
- Follow existing Next.js App Router patterns with proper client component boundaries
- Use established ShadCN UI integration patterns from existing components
- Follow SupportSignal design system patterns from Story 2.0 implementation
- Use testing patterns from centralized `tests/web/components/` structure
- Integrate with existing accessibility compliance standards from healthcare component library

## Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/web/components/workflow/` directory (centralized testing pattern)
**Testing Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
**Required Testing Standards**:
- **Unit Tests**: Component behavior, state management, validation logic
- **Integration Tests**: Auto-save functionality, session recovery, step progression
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance using jest-axe
- **Mobile Tests**: Responsive design validation and touch interaction testing
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: iOS Safari and Android Chrome compatibility verification
