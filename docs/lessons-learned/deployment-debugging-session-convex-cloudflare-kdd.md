# Deployment Debugging Session: Convex + Cloudflare Pages - KDD
## 12-Hour Production Deployment Investigation

**Period**: October 31, 2025 - November 1, 2025
**Session Start**: `ec0a8d0` - Feature completion with passing tests
**Session End**: `403a0d3` - Production deployment verified and functional
**Total Commits**: 30
**Domain**: Multi-platform deployment coordination (Next.js + Convex + Cloudflare Pages)

---

## Problem Statement

**Symptom**: Production deployment showed empty data despite backend containing records.

**Context**: After feature implementation completed with passing local tests, production deployment exhibited the following issues:
- Browser console: `apiKeys: Array(0)`, `hasListGroups: false`
- Backend CLI queries returned expected data (4 groups, 9 prompts)
- Local development environment worked correctly
- No errors in deployment logs

**Root Causes Discovered**: 4 independent issues requiring different solutions.

## Critical Issues Discovered and Fixed

### Issue 1: Stale Generated Files (`7f7eb68`)
**Problem**: `apps/web/convex/_generated/api.d.ts` from Oct 2 (2 months old) overriding fresh generated API
**Impact**: TypeScript resolved to stale file despite path alias pointing to `apps/convex/_generated/`
**Fix**:
- Deleted `apps/web/convex/_generated/`
- Added to `.gitignore`

**Files Changed**:
- Deleted: `apps/web/convex/_generated/` (entire directory)
- Modified: `apps/web/.gitignore`

### Issue 2: Dual Deployment Conflict (`ef1fbce`, `7ff9a62`)
**Problem**:
- GitHub Actions deployment succeeded (using bun)
- Cloudflare auto-deploy failed (using npm with peer dependency conflicts)
- Production stuck on old build

**Impact**: CI showed success but production not updated
**Fix**:
- Changed from `cloudflare/pages-action@v1` to direct `wrangler pages deploy`
- User manually disabled Cloudflare auto-deploy in dashboard

**Files Changed**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (deploy step)
- `docs/lessons-learned/cloudflare-dual-deployment-kdd.md` (new)

### Issue 3: CI Job Ordering (`ac4d910`)
**Problem**: Web app built before Convex backend deployed
**Impact**: Generated API files used stale Convex schema
**Fix**: Added `needs: [deploy-convex]` to build job

**Files Changed**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (job dependencies)

### Issue 4: Missing Production Migration
**Problem**: Production database had 0 prompt groups (dev had 4)
**Impact**: Production showed "No Groups Yet" despite prompts existing
**Fix**: Ran `bunx convex run --prod migrations/assignPromptsToGroups:seedDefaultGroups`

**Note**: This was NOT a code issue - migration script existed but wasn't run in production

## Anomaly Check

### ‚úÖ Expected Changes
- CI pipeline improvements (13 commits) - Normal for new feature deployment
- TypeScript fixes (2 commits) - CI caught issues local didn't
- Dependency additions (2 commits) - New drag-and-drop feature
- Debug logging (7 commits) - Systematic troubleshooting
- KDD documentation (3 commits) - Knowledge capture

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Unexpected Changes (But Correct)
- Stale file deletion - Should have been caught earlier but necessary
- Dual deployment fix - Architectural improvement discovered during debugging
- CI job reordering - Should have been in original Story 11.0

### ‚ùå No Anomalies Detected
- All commits have clear purpose
- No reverted changes
- No contradictory fixes
- No unexplained file modifications
- No security concerns

---

## Comparison: Original vs Current

### Files Identical to Story 11.0 Completion
- All Convex backend files (no changes post-completion)
- Migration script (no changes post-completion)
- Core UI components (only debug logging added, no logic changes)

### Files Enhanced Post-Completion
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - More robust deployment pipeline
- `apps/web/.gitignore` - Prevents stale file reoccurrence
- Documentation - 2 new KDD files

### Legitimate Debug Code Still Present
- Version banners in `apps/web/app/admin/ai-prompts/page.tsx`
- Console logging in `PromptGroupManager.tsx`
- CI verification checks in workflow

**Recommendation**: Remove debug code in next cleanup story

---

## Production Readiness Assessment

### ‚úÖ Deployed and Working
- Story 11.0 feature complete
- CI/CD pipeline functional
- Production database seeded
- No known bugs

### üîß Technical Debt Created
1. Debug logging in production code (low priority)
2. Version banners in UI (low priority)
3. CI verification steps that could be simplified (low priority)

### üìã Follow-up Items
1. Clean up debug logging (Story 11.1 or 11.2)
2. Remove version banners (Story 11.1 or 11.2)
3. Simplify CI verification once stability confirmed (future)
4. Document migration execution in deployment checklist (documentation)

## Conclusion

**Session Metrics**:
- **Total Commits**: 30
- **Duration**: 12 hours
- **Issues Resolved**: 4 independent root causes
- **Code Anomalies**: None detected
- **Architecture Improvements**: 2 major (stale file prevention, deployment pipeline robustness)
- **Technical Debt**: Minimal (debug code only, scheduled for cleanup)
- **Production Status**: ‚úÖ Stable and functional

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Check database state first** - "Server has data, browser shows empty" often indicates missing database migrations, not deployment issues
2. **Stale file detection protocol** - Use 5-minute diagnostic checklist before investigating complex deployment theories
3. **Dual deployment conflicts** - Disable platform auto-deploy when using CI/CD to prevent build tool conflicts
4. **CI job dependencies** - Ensure backend deploys before frontend builds to guarantee fresh generated types

**Reusable Patterns**:
- Stale file diagnostic protocol: `docs/lessons-learned/debugging-stale-generated-files-kdd.md`
- Dual deployment conflict resolution: `docs/lessons-learned/cloudflare-dual-deployment-kdd.md`
- Environment variable propagation patterns (this document)
- Database migration verification checklist (pending documentation)
