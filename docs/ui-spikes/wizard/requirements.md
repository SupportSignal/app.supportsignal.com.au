## üìê Implementation Guidance

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with minimal variant, add complexity iteratively
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, add advanced features
3. **Component Composition**: Design reusable step components for different content types
4. **State Management**: Use simple, predictable state patterns
5. **Testing First**: Write tests for each feature before implementation

### Architecture Considerations
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep wizard logic separate from step content
- **Event-Driven**: Use events for step changes and data updates
- **Configuration-Based**: Make wizard behavior configurable rather than hardcoded
- **Error Boundaries**: Gracefully handle component failures
- **Performance**: Optimize for smooth interactions and quick responses
