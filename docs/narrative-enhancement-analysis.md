# Narrative Enhancement Analysis & Implementation Plan

**Document Created**: January 21, 2025  
**Context**: Analysis of James Brown incident workflow data to identify what's missing for enhanced narratives  
**Status**: Planning Phase - Implementation Needed

## Current Workflow State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working Well

**Participant Consistency**: James maintained perfectly throughout all narrative phases
- Name consistency across all phases
- Character continuity showing logical behavioral escalation
- Setting consistency (day program center) maintained
- Behavioral patterns show coherent progression: unusual comments → allegations → threats → delusional statements

**Question-Narrative Alignment**: AI successfully extracts and builds contextual questions
- Before Event: Questions about "watermelon comment", creative activities, staff responses
- During Event: Questions about "frying pan statement", cooking group, witness accounts  
- End Event: Questions about "self-harm threats", ice cream demand, de-escalation
- Post Event: Questions about "aliens/goldfish statement", behavior plan updates

**Answer Quality**: Mock answers demonstrate strong contextual understanding
- Specific references to narrative details (Sarah, Tom, staff ratios, protocols)
- Realistic operational details (communication tools, intervention procedures)
- Appropriate emotional responses and professional language
- Environmental context (room layout, noise levels, visual schedules)

## What's Missing: Enhanced Narratives for Workflow Managers

### Current Problem
- Raw narrative phases exist separately from Q&A investigation
- No consolidated professional summary suitable for external review
- Missing executive-level overview for management consumption
- No structured format combining investigation findings with original incident

### Required Enhanced Narrative Structure

```
INCIDENT SUMMARY - [Participant Name] - [Date]

OVERVIEW:
[2-3 sentence executive summary of the incident and outcome]

DETAILED ACCOUNT:
[Chronological narrative integrating original phases with key clarification details]

KEY FINDINGS FROM INVESTIGATION:
[Bullet points of important details revealed through Q&A process]

ACTIONS TAKEN:
[Immediate responses and ongoing support measures]

RECOMMENDATIONS:
[Forward-looking prevention and support strategies]

STAFF SIGNATURES: [Validation section]
```

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Auto-Generated Enhanced Narrative
**Combine Elements**:
- Original narrative phases as chronological backbone
- Key clarification details woven in contextually
- Professional language suitable for external review
- Investigation insights integrated seamlessly

### 2. Contextual Intelligence Integration
**Include from Q&A Process**:
- Environmental factors identified (noise levels, room layout, stimulation)
- Participant history patterns revealed (previous similar incidents)
- Intervention effectiveness assessments (what worked/didn't work)
- Witness accounts and staff perspectives
- Trigger identification and prevention opportunities

### 3. Multi-Audience Structure
**Executive Summary**: For workflow managers and administrators
- High-level incident overview
- Key risk factors and mitigation
- Compliance status and next steps

**Detailed Account**: For clinical review and case management
- Complete chronological narrative with investigation details
- Environmental and behavioral analysis
- Intervention documentation and effectiveness

**Regulatory Compliance**: For external reporting requirements
- NDIS reporting format compliance
- Risk assessment documentation
- Follow-up action plans

## Technical Implementation Approach

### AI Enhancement Process
1. **Narrative Consolidation**: Combine four phases with Q&A insights
2. **Professional Language**: Transform conversational Q&A into formal documentation
3. **Key Finding Extraction**: Identify critical details from investigation
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Suggest prevention and support strategies
5. **Format Standardization**: Apply consistent professional structure

### Data Integration Points
- Original narrative phases (before_event, during_event, end_event, post_event)
- Clarification questions and answers for each phase
- Participant details and support requirements
- Environmental factors and triggers identified
- Staff interventions and their effectiveness

## Example Enhanced Narrative Output

**INCIDENT SUMMARY - James Brown - August 5, 2024**

**OVERVIEW:**
James Brown experienced a behavioral escalation during day program activities, progressing from unusual comments to concerning allegations and self-harm threats. Staff successfully implemented crisis intervention protocols, and James was stabilized with one-on-one support. Mental health consultation has been arranged.

**DETAILED ACCOUNT:**
During morning creative activities, James made unusual comments about a watermelon that initially caused mild disruption but was managed appropriately by staff redirection. The situation escalated during cooking group when James became withdrawn and overstimulated by noise levels. He then made a concerning false allegation about being hit with a frying pan, which required immediate staff intervention to reassure other participants while providing James with focused support...

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Weekend Planning Tasks
1. **Define AI prompt template** for narrative enhancement generation
2. **Design enhanced narrative database schema** (if needed)
3. **Plan integration points** with existing workflow system
4. **Identify template customization** for different incident types
5. **Consider regulatory compliance** requirements for enhanced format

### Technical Development Requirements
- AI prompt engineering for professional narrative generation
- Integration with existing clarification workflow
- Template system for different audience needs
- Export functionality for external sharing
- Version control for enhanced narratives

## Success Criteria

**Quality Metrics**:
- Enhanced narratives provide complete incident picture
- Professional language suitable for external review  
- Investigation insights properly integrated
- Actionable recommendations included

**Workflow Integration**:
- Seamless generation from existing Q&A data
- Multiple format options for different audiences
- Easy export and sharing capabilities
- Maintains all audit trail requirements

**Note**: This analysis shows the current workflow is functioning excellently post-fix. The narrative access issue has been resolved, and the system now generates contextually relevant questions and answers. The enhanced narrative feature represents the final step to create management-ready incident documentation.
