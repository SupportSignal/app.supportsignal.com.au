## Epic Overview

**Goal**: Enable SupportSignal system administrators to rapidly onboard new service provider companies with minimal initial setup - creating the company, setting up sites, adding users, and adding participants to get the organization operational within 24 hours.

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Team Size**: 1-2 developers (backend, frontend focus)
**Dependencies**: Epic 1 (Authentication)
**Primary Users**: System administrators (SupportSignal employees)
**Requirements Source**: [Multi-Tenant Administration Requirements Analysis](../multi-tenant-administration-requirements.md)

**Note**: This epic focuses on **lightweight rapid onboarding** from the SupportSignal perspective. Full self-service user and participant management by company administrators will be addressed in Epic 9.

**Important**: Site creation and deletion is **system admin only** (Epic 7). Company admins can **rename sites** in Epic 9 but cannot create or delete them.

---

## Business Context

Epic 7 enables SupportSignal system administrators to quickly onboard new service provider organizations. This is the **initial setup phase** where SupportSignal staff prepare a new company for operation by creating the company record, setting up sites (locations), setting up initial users (admin + frontline workers), and adding sample participants.

**Key Business Drivers**:
- **Rapid Onboarding**: Get new service providers operational within 24 hours
- **Minimal Setup**: System admin adds just enough data to make the company functional
- **Site-Based Organization**: Participants belong to sites (physical locations) for better organization
- **Handoff to Company**: After initial setup, company admins take over ongoing management
- **Revenue Enablement**: Fast time-to-value for new customers

**Success Metrics**:
- **Onboarding Speed**: New companies operational in <24 hours
- **Setup Efficiency**: System admin can onboard a company in <30 minutes
- **Initial Data**: Company has 1+ sites, 1 admin + 2-5 users, 5-10 participants assigned to sites
- **Handoff Success**: Company admin can immediately access their dashboard and data

**Scope Clarification**:
- **IN SCOPE**: System admin lightweight setup (company + sites + initial users + sample participants)
- **IN SCOPE**: Site creation and deletion by system admins
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Company admin self-service management (see Epic 9)
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Bulk imports, advanced NDIS compliance features (see Epic 9)
- **NOTE**: Company admins can rename sites in Epic 9 (but not create/delete)

---

## Multi-Tenant Site Architecture

**Key Concept: Sites represent physical locations where frontline workers look after participants.**

```
Company (NDIS Service Provider)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sites (1 or more locations)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Site 1 (e.g., "North Sydney Office")
        ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant 1
        ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant 2
        ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant 3
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Site 2 (e.g., "Parramatta Branch")
              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant 4
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant 5

Incidents
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Linked to Site (dropdown selection during incident capture)
```

**Relationships**:
- Company ‚Üí Sites (one-to-many)
- Site ‚Üí Participants (one-to-many)
- Incident ‚Üí Site (many-to-one)
- Participants MUST have a site before creation
- Incidents capture which site the incident occurred at

### Story 7.3: Site Management (System Admin)

**Status**: **PLANNED** üìã
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: Story 7.2 (User setup)

#### CRITICAL PREREQUISITES - Schema Changes Required

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Before implementing Story 7.3, the following schema changes MUST be made to `apps/convex/schema.ts`:

**1. Add Sites Table:**
```typescript
sites: defineTable({
  _id: v.id("sites"),
  company_id: v.id("companies"),
  name: v.string(),
  created_at: v.number(),
  created_by: v.id("users"),
  updated_at: v.optional(v.number())
})
  .index("by_company", ["company_id"])
  .index("by_name", ["company_id", "name"])
```

**2. Update Participants Table** (for Story 7.4):
```typescript
participants: defineTable({
  // ... existing fields ...
  site_id: v.id("sites"),  // NEW FIELD - REQUIRED
  // ... existing fields ...
})
  .index("by_site", ["site_id"])  // NEW INDEX
  .index("by_company_and_site", ["company_id", "site_id"])  // NEW INDEX
```

**3. Update Incidents Table** (for Story 7.6):
```typescript
incidents: defineTable({
  // ... existing fields ...
  site_id: v.id("sites"),  // NEW FIELD - REQUIRED
  // ... existing fields ...
})
  .index("by_site", ["site_id"])  // NEW INDEX
  .index("by_company_and_site", ["company_id", "site_id"])  // NEW INDEX
```

**Schema Deployment**: These changes must be deployed to Convex before proceeding with frontend implementation.

#### Requirements

**Problem**: Service provider companies have multiple physical locations (sites) where frontline workers look after participants. Currently, there's no way to organize participants by location. The system needs site management to properly organize participants by their physical care location.

**Solution**: Implement site management system where system admins create and manage sites for companies. Participants will be assigned to sites. This provides better organization and will enable future features like site-specific reporting and rostering.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Sites Database Schema**: New `sites` table with company relationship
- **Site CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete sites for a company
- **Primary Site Convention**: Each company must have at least one site (default: "Primary")
- **Site Validation**: Prevent deletion of sites that have participants assigned
- **Data Migration**: Create "Primary" site for all existing companies and link existing participants

**Scope**: System admin creates and deletes sites. Company admins can **rename sites** in Epic 9 (but not create/delete).

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Sites Database Schema**: New `sites` table with `company_id`, `name`, `created_at` fields
- [ ] **Site Management Interface**: System admin interface at `/admin/companies/{id}/sites`
- [ ] **Create Site**: Form to add new site to a company
- [ ] **List Sites**: View all sites for a company with participant counts
- [ ] **Edit Site**: Update site name and details
- [ ] **Delete Site**: Remove site (validation: cannot delete if has participants)
- [ ] **Default Site Creation**: Auto-create "Primary" site when company is created
- [ ] **Site Validation**: Enforce at least one site per company
- [ ] **Migration Script**: Create "Primary" site for all existing companies
- [ ] **Participant Migration**: Link all existing participants to their company's Primary site
- [ ] **Backend Functions**: `sites.admin.*` functions for CRUD operations
- [ ] **Company Scoping**: Sites are company-scoped, system admin can manage all sites

#### Migration Strategy

**The migration must follow this exact order to maintain referential integrity:**

**Phase 1: Schema Setup** (Story 7.3 start)
1. Add `sites` table to `apps/convex/schema.ts`
2. Deploy schema changes to Convex (`bunx convex deploy`)
3. Verify table creation using Convex dashboard or `bunx convex data sites`
4. Confirm `sites` table is ready before proceeding

**Phase 2: Create Primary Sites** (Story 7.3 implementation)
1. Develop migration script: `sites.migration.createPrimarySitesForExistingCompanies()`
2. For each company without sites:
   - Create site with name "Primary"
   - Set `company_id` to link to company
   - Set `created_by` to system admin user
   - Set `created_at` to current timestamp
3. Verify all companies have at least one site
4. Log all site creation operations for audit trail

**Phase 3: Update Participants Schema** (Story 7.4 prerequisite)
1. Add `site_id: v.id("sites")` field to `participants` table in schema.ts
2. Add indexes: `by_site` and `by_company_and_site`
3. Deploy schema changes to Convex
4. Develop migration script: `participants.migration.linkToPrimarySites()`
5. For each participant without `site_id`:
   - Find participant's `company_id`
   - Find company's Primary site
   - Set `participant.site_id = primary_site._id`
6. Verify all participants have `site_id` populated
7. Log all participant updates for audit trail

**Phase 4: Update Incidents Schema** (Story 7.6 prerequisite)
1. Add `site_id: v.id("sites")` field to `incidents` table in schema.ts
2. Add indexes: `by_site` and `by_company_and_site`
3. Deploy schema changes to Convex
4. Develop migration script: `incidents.migration.linkToPrimarySites()`
5. For each incident without `site_id`:
   - Find incident's company via `participant.company_id`
   - Find company's Primary site
   - Set `incident.site_id = primary_site._id`
6. Verify all incidents have `site_id` populated
7. Log all incident updates for audit trail

**Story 7.3 Completion Criteria:**

Story 7.3 is ONLY complete when:
- ‚úÖ Sites table exists in `schema.ts` and deployed to Convex
- ‚úÖ Primary sites created for all existing companies
- ‚úÖ Migration scripts tested and documented
- ‚úÖ Site CRUD backend functions implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ Site management UI functional (`/admin/companies/{id}/sites`)
- ‚úÖ All acceptance criteria met

**Migration Script Locations:**
```
apps/convex/sites/migration.ts       // createPrimarySitesForExistingCompanies
apps/convex/participants/migration.ts // linkToPrimarySites
apps/convex/incidents/migration.ts    // linkToPrimarySites
```

### Story 7.4: Initial Participant Setup (System Admin)

**Status**: **PLANNED** üìã
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: Story 7.3 (Sites must exist before participants)

#### Requirements

**Problem**: After creating a company, setting up users, and creating sites, the system admin needs a quick way to add 5-10 sample participants so the company can start using the incident capture workflow immediately. **Participants must be assigned to a site.**

**Solution**: System admin interface to quickly add initial participants with basic NDIS information and site assignment - just enough to make the system functional.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Participant Creation Form**: Simple form for adding participants one at a time
- **Site Selection**: Dropdown to select site (required field)
- **Company Scoping**: Participants automatically associated with the company
- **Basic NDIS Data**: First name, last name, NDIS number, support level
- **No Bulk Import**: Lightweight individual participant creation (bulk operations in Epic 9)

**Scope**: Quick setup of 5-10 participants for initial operation. Full participant lifecycle management is in Epic 9.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Participant Form**: System admin interface at `/admin/companies/{id}/participants/create`

### Story 7.6: Incident Capture Site Selection

**Status**: **PLANNED** üìã
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Story 7.3 (Sites must exist)

#### Requirements

**Problem**: When frontline workers capture incidents, the system needs to know which site (location) the incident occurred at. This enables site-specific reporting and helps track which locations have the most incidents.

**Solution**: Add site selection dropdown to the incident capture wizard on the first page, positioned just above the location text field. All incidents must be associated with a site.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Incident Schema Update**: Add `site_id` field to incidents table (required)
- **Site Dropdown**: Dropdown showing company's sites on incident wizard page 1
- **Site Selection**: Required field - cannot proceed without selecting site
- **Default Behavior**: If company has only one site, auto-select it
- **Data Migration**: Populate all existing incidents with their company's Primary site

**Scope**: Add site selection to incident capture. Site-based incident reporting comes in future epic.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Incident Schema Update**: Add `site_id` field to incidents table (required, references sites)
- [ ] **Site Dropdown**: Add site selection dropdown on incident wizard page 1
- [ ] **Dropdown Position**: Place dropdown just above location text field
- [ ] **Site Data**: Dropdown shows all sites for the user's company
- [ ] **Required Field**: Site selection is required to proceed in wizard
- [ ] **Auto-Select**: If company has only one site, automatically select it
- [ ] **Validation**: Cannot create incident without site selection
- [ ] **Migration Script**: Populate all existing incidents with Primary site
- [ ] **Incident List**: Show site information in incident listings
- [ ] **Site Filter**: Add site filter to incident search/filter interface

**Migration Requirements**:
```typescript
// Migration: Link existing incidents to Primary site
// For each incident without site_id:
//   - Find the incident's company (via participant ‚Üí company)
//   - Find the company's Primary site
//   - Set incident.site_id = primary_site._id
```

```typescript
// For all existing companies without sites:
// 1. Create a site named "Primary"
// 2. Associate with company
// 3. Mark as default site

migration.sites.createPrimarySitesForExistingCompanies();
```

### Migration 2: Link Participants to Primary Site (Story 7.3)
```typescript
// For all existing participants without site_id:
// 1. Find the participant's company
// 2. Get the company's Primary site
// 3. Set participant.site_id = primary_site._id

migration.participants.linkToPrimarySites();
```

### Migration 3: Link Incidents to Primary Site (Story 7.6)
```typescript
// For all existing incidents without site_id:
// 1. Find the incident's company (via participant)
// 2. Get the company's Primary site

**Story 7.5**: üìã **PLANNED** - System-wide company management & editing
**Story 7.6**: üìã **PLANNED** - Incident capture site selection

**Epic 7 Target Deliverables**:
- ‚úÖ **Rapid Company Creation**: System admin can create companies with initial admin
- ‚úÖ **User Onboarding**: System admin can invite initial users with full workflow
- üìã **Site Management**: System admin creates and manages sites for companies
- üìã **Participant Setup**: System admin can add sample participants to sites
- üìã **Company Management**: Edit companies and system-wide oversight with test cleanup
- üìã **Incident Site Tracking**: Incidents capture which site they occurred at

**Success Criteria**:
- System admin can onboard a new company in <30 minutes
- New companies have 1+ sites, 1 admin + 2-5 users, 5-10 participants assigned to sites
- Company admins receive welcome emails and can log in immediately
- System admin can edit company details after creation
- Participants are organized by site (physical location)
- Incidents track which site they occurred at
- Test companies can be cleaned up with full data cascade deletion (including sites)

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks (Updated for Sites)
- ‚úÖ **Email Delivery**: Mitigated - tested and working in Stories 7.1 and 7.2
- ‚úÖ **Token Security**: Mitigated - cryptographically secure implementation in Story 7.2
- **Site Migration**: Risk of data inconsistency when linking existing participants and incidents to Primary sites
- **Site Deletion**: Risk of orphaned participants if site deletion validation fails
- **Participant Data Quality**: Risk of incorrect NDIS numbers during rapid setup
- **Test Data Cleanup**: Risk of accidentally deleting production companies
- **Company Editing Conflicts**: Risk of concurrent edits by multiple system admins

### Mitigation Strategies
- ‚úÖ **Email Integration**: Proven working with Cloudflare Worker + Resend
- ‚úÖ **Token Security**: Cryptographic token generation with expiration implemented
- **Migration Safety**: Comprehensive migration scripts with validation and rollback capability
- **Site Validation**: Strict validation preventing deletion of sites with participants
- **NDIS Validation**: Basic format validation to prevent obvious errors
- **Cleanup Safety**: Multi-step confirmation with preview before deletion
- **Status Filtering**: Only companies with `status: "test"` can be cleaned up
- **Edit Locking**: Optimistic concurrency control for company editing

## Epic Scope Clarification (Important)

**Epic 7 Focus**: **Rapid onboarding by SupportSignal system administrators**
- Create company + initial admin (‚úÖ Done)
- Edit company details (üìã Planned)
- Add 2-5 initial users (‚öôÔ∏è Backend done)
- **Create and manage sites** (üìã Planned - NEW)
- Add 5-10 sample participants **to sites** (üìã Planned - UPDATED)
- Configure incident capture **with site selection** (üìã Planned - NEW)
- System oversight and test cleanup (üìã Planned)

**Epic 9 Focus**: **Self-service operations by service provider company administrators**
- Full user lifecycle management
- Full participant lifecycle with NDIS compliance
- Bulk operations and data imports
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- **Site renaming**: Company admins can rename sites (but not create/delete)

This separation ensures Epic 7 stays focused on initial setup with the new site organization model, while Epic 9 provides ongoing operational management. Company admins have limited site management (rename only) to customize their location names without requiring system admin intervention.
