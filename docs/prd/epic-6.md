### Story 6.2: Phase-Specific Question Generation Prompts

**Status**: **IN PROGRESS** ðŸš§  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Dependencies**: Story 6.1 (Core prompt management foundation)

#### Requirements
**Problem**: The current system uses one generic `"generate_clarification_questions"` prompt that attempts to handle all four incident phases (`before_event`, `during_event`, `end_event`, `post_event`) by passing the phase as a parameter. This creates suboptimal results because each phase requires different investigation focus areas and question types.

**Solution**: Split the single generic prompt into four specialized, phase-specific prompts that are optimized for their particular phase context and investigation needs.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Replace single prompt**: Convert from `"generate_clarification_questions"` to four distinct prompts:
  - `"generate_clarification_questions_before_event"`
  - `"generate_clarification_questions_during_event"`
  - `"generate_clarification_questions_end_event"`
  - `"generate_clarification_questions_post_event"`
- **Update question generator**: Modify `questionGenerator.ts` to dynamically select prompt based on phase
- **Remove phase variable**: Each prompt will have phase-specific context hardcoded, removing need for `{{phase}}` variable
- **Optimize for phase context**: Each prompt tailored for specific investigation priorities and question types

**Phase-Specific Optimizations**:
- **Before Event**: Focus on antecedents, environmental factors, participant state
- **During Event**: Focus on actions taken, interventions attempted, safety measures
- **End Event**: Focus on resolution strategies, de-escalation techniques, immediate outcomes
- **Post Event**: Focus on follow-up care, support plan modifications, lesson learned

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Four Phase-Specific Prompts**: Create specialized prompts for each incident phase
- [ ] **Dynamic Prompt Selection**: Update questionGenerator.ts to select prompt based on `args.phase`
- [ ] **Hardcoded Phase Context**: Remove generic `{{phase}}` variable, embed phase context in each prompt
- [ ] **Maintain Existing API**: No breaking changes to existing question generation interface
- [ ] **Database Migration**: Add new prompts to DEFAULT_PROMPTS and seed in database
- [ ] **Testing**: Verify each phase generates appropriate, phase-specific questions
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update prompt management documentation with new phase-specific approach

### Story 6.3: Developer Prompt Testing & Interpolation Interface

**Status**: **PLANNED** ðŸ“‹  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Dependencies**: Story 6.2 (Phase-specific prompts)

#### Requirements
**Problem**: Developers need to test and refine AI prompts during development, but currently must modify database records or code to experiment with prompt variations. There's no easy way to see prompt interpolation in real-time or test different variable combinations.

**Solution**: Extend the existing developer experience control (shown at bottom of incident workflows) to provide comprehensive prompt testing and interpolation capabilities for developers.

**Developer Interface Enhancements**:
- **Prompt Visibility**: Show the current prompt template being used for AI calls
- **Interpolation Preview**: Display all `{{placeholder}}` variables and their current values
- **Property Grid**: Show all input variables going into the prompt with their values
- **Extensible Variables**: Allow adding custom key-value pairs for testing without saving to database
- **Real-time Preview**: Show the fully interpolated prompt that will be sent to the AI
- **Test Execution**: Button to execute the prompt with current variables and see AI response
- **Template Override**: Temporarily modify prompt template for testing (not saved to database)

**Use Cases**:
- **Prompt Development**: Test prompt modifications before updating database templates
- **Variable Testing**: Try different variable combinations to optimize AI responses
- **Debugging**: See exactly what prompt was sent when investigating AI issues
- **Optimization**: Experiment with special instructions or additional context variables

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Developer Controls Extension**: Extend existing developer toolbar with prompt testing capabilities
- [ ] **Prompt Template Display**: Show current active prompt template being used
- [ ] **Variable Visualization**: Display all template variables and their current values in a property grid
- [ ] **Extensible Variables**: Allow adding/modifying variables without database changes
- [ ] **Real-time Interpolation**: Show live preview of fully interpolated prompt
- [ ] **Template Override**: Allow temporary prompt template modifications for testing
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Execute prompt with current variables and display AI response
- [ ] **Developer-Only Access**: Ensure interface only appears for users with developer permissions
- [ ] **No Database Changes**: All modifications are temporary and not persisted
- [ ] **Context Awareness**: Show relevant prompt testing for current workflow step/page
