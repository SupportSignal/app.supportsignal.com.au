# Epic 8: Environment Architecture & Deployment Separation

> **Quick Navigation:** [8.1](#story-81-convex-environment-separation--production-connection) · [8.2](#story-82-environment-aware-url-configuration-system) · [8.3](#story-83-oauth-production-application-setup) · [8.4](#story-84-deployment-pipeline--configuration-management)

## Epic Overview

**Goal**: Establish proper development and production environment separation with correct deployment architecture, eliminating shared database issues and hardcoded localhost URLs in production systems.

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Team Size**: 1-2 developers (backend, DevOps focus)
**Dependencies**: All previous epics (affects core infrastructure)
**Primary Users**: System administrators, developers, end users
**Requirements Source**: Critical infrastructure issues discovered during Story 7.1 implementation

---

## Business Context

Epic 8 addresses **critical production infrastructure failures** discovered during Story 7.1 implementation. The current system has fundamental environment separation problems that cause production emails to contain localhost URLs and both environments to share the same database.

**Key Business Drivers**:
- **Production Reliability**: Eliminate localhost URLs in production emails and authentication
- **Data Integrity**: Separate development and production data to prevent accidental corruption
- **Security Compliance**: Proper OAuth configuration for production vs development
- **Operational Excellence**: Reliable deployment pipelines with environment-specific configuration

**Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Resolution**:
- 🚨 **Shared Database**: Both dev and production using same Convex deployment (`beaming-gull-639`)
- 🚨 **Production Email Bug**: Production emails contain `localhost:3200` URLs instead of `app.supportsignal.com.au`
- 🚨 **OAuth Failures**: Authentication callbacks fail in production due to domain mismatches
- 🚨 **Configuration Chaos**: 7 server functions accessing wrong environment variables

**Success Metrics**:
- **Environment Separation**: 100% data isolation between dev and production
- **URL Correctness**: 100% of production emails contain correct domain URLs
- **Authentication Success**: 100% OAuth success rate in production
- **Deployment Reliability**: Zero environment configuration errors in CI/CD

## Current State Analysis

### **Deployment Architecture Issues**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Local Dev localhost:3200] --> C[beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud]
    B[Production app.supportsignal.com.au] --> C
    C --> D[SHARED DATABASE ❌]

    E[Server Functions] --> F[process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL]
    F --> G[localhost:3200 in Production ❌]
```

### **Environment Variable Problems**

**Current Configuration**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3200` (dev value used everywhere)
- Server functions incorrectly accessing client-side `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables
- No environment detection in Convex functions
- Cloudflare Pages using dev environment configuration

**Affected Components**:
1. **Email System** (`apps/convex/email.ts:14`) - Hardcoded localhost fallback
2. **OAuth Callbacks** (`apps/convex/auth.ts`) - 4 instances of wrong URLs
3. **Worker Communication** (`apps/convex/workerSync.ts`) - Wrong worker URLs
4. **Password Reset** - Wrong domain in reset links

## Target Architecture

### **Proper Environment Separation**

    A[Local Dev localhost:3200] --> B[dev:beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud]
    C[Production app.supportsignal.com.au] --> D[prod:graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud]

    E[Environment-Aware Config] --> F[Dynamic URL Generation]
    F --> G[Correct URLs in All Environments ✅]
```

### **Configuration Strategy**

**Environment Detection Approach**:
- **Server-side**: Use Convex deployment context for environment detection
- **Client-side**: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables properly
- **Hybrid config**: Centralized configuration module with multiple detection strategies

## Environment Management System Operations

**🚨 ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**: The sync-env.js script had a critical architectural flaw where local files could be overwritten with production values. This has been corrected.

**Key Principle**: **Local `.env.local` files NEVER contain production values.**

### **Primary Documentation**

For complete sync-env.js operational details, see:
- **[Environment Management Technical Guide](../technical-guides/environment-management.md)** - Complete operational documentation
- **[Configuration Management Protocols](../technical-guides/configuration-management-protocols.md)** - Usage best practices

### **Critical Architecture Summary**

```
LOCAL MODE (Default):
~/.env-configs/[project].env → Local files (ALWAYS dev values)
                             → apps/web/.env.local
                             → apps/convex/.env.local

DEPLOYMENT MODE:
~/.env-configs/[project].env → Cloud platforms (dev/prod values)
                             → Convex deployment
                             → Cloudflare Pages dashboard
                             → Workers via wrangler
```

### **Required Manual Source-of-Truth Updates**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - User has updated `~/.env-configs/app.supportsignal.com.au.env` with correct production values.

**Key Changes Made**:
- `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`: `dev:beaming-gull-639` → `prod:graceful-shrimp-355`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`: `beaming-gull-639.convex.cloud` → `graceful-shrimp-355.convex.cloud`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Updated for production URLs

### **Quick Commands Reference**

```bash
# LOCAL (Most Common - Always dev values)
bun run sync-env                    # Generate local dev files

# DEPLOYMENT (Cloud platforms only)
bun run sync-env:deploy-dev         # Deploy to dev Convex
bun run sync-env:deploy-prod        # BLOCKED (security)
```

For detailed commands, features, troubleshooting, and verification procedures, see the **[Environment Management Technical Guide](../technical-guides/environment-management.md)**.
