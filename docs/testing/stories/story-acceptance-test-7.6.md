## Test Execution Notes

### Browser Console Debugging

**Expected Console Logs (During Auto-Population)**:
```javascript
üè¢ AUTO-POPULATED SITE
{
  participantId: "...",
  participantName: "John Smith",
  siteId: "..."
}
```

**Red Flags to Watch For**:
- Empty value warnings from Select component (should be guarded)
- Validation errors appearing prematurely
- Site_id undefined or null errors
- API errors when fetching sites

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Site doesn't auto-populate | Participant missing site_id | Verify participant has site_id in database |
| Validation error on auto-fill | Validation not cleared | Check error clearing in handleParticipantSelect |
| Site filter shows no results | Index not deployed | Redeploy Convex schema |
| Migration not complete | Migration not run | Run bunx convex run migrations:backfillIncidentSites |

---

## Production Deployment Checklist

**Before Production Deployment**:
- [ ] All UAT tests pass in development
- [ ] Migration function tested in development
- [ ] Backup production database (if possible)
- [ ] Verify all production participants have site_id

**Production Deployment Steps**:
1. Deploy Convex schema (includes new site_id field and indexes)
2. Run migration: `bunx convex run --prod migrations:backfillIncidentSites`
3. Verify migration success (check logs for errors)
4. Deploy frontend changes
5. Spot-check 10 production incidents for site information
6. Monitor error logs for 24 hours

**Rollback Plan** (if needed):
- Schema change is backwards compatible (site_id optional)
- Frontend can be rolled back independently
- Migration is idempotent (safe to re-run)

## Test Data Recommendations

### Ideal Test Scenario Setup

**Company Setup**:
- Company Name: "Test Care Services"
- Sites: Primary, North Site, South Site, Central Hub

**Participant Setup**:
- Participant 1: John Smith ‚Üí Primary site
- Participant 2: Emma Johnson ‚Üí North Site
- Participant 3: Michael Brown ‚Üí South Site
- Participant 4: Sarah Williams ‚Üí Central Hub

**Existing Incidents**:
- 5 incidents at Primary site
