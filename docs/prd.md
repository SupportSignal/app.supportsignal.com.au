# SupportSignal - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**SupportSignal** is an AI-powered incident reporting and analysis platform designed specifically for NDIS service providers. The system transforms fragmented, manual incident reporting processes (Slack messages, Excel spreadsheets, paper forms) into a structured, comprehensive digital workflow that ensures compliance, improves safety outcomes, and enables data-driven operational improvements.

**Vision**: Empower frontline disability support workers and team leaders to capture, analyze, and learn from incidents through intelligent, guided workflows that reduce cognitive load while increasing data quality and compliance consistency.

## Project Overview

### Core Problem Statement

NDIS service providers currently struggle with inconsistent incident reporting methods that fail to capture sufficient detail for regulatory compliance, safety analysis, and operational improvement. Critical incident information is often lost in informal communication channels or incomplete manual forms, creating compliance risks and missed opportunities for preventive measures.

### Solution Approach

SupportSignal provides a guided, AI-enhanced incident reporting system featuring:

- **Intelligent Capture Workflow**: 7-step wizard that guides frontline workers through comprehensive incident documentation
- **AI-Powered Clarification**: Context-aware follow-up questions generated from initial narratives
- **Structured Analysis Process**: Team leader workflow for analyzing contributing conditions and classifying incidents
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Convex-powered real-time updates and team coordination
- **Compliance-Ready Outputs**: Structured reports suitable for regulatory requirements and organizational learning
