# KDD-to-Codebase Alignment Audit Report

**Generated:** 2025-08-12  
**Purpose:** Systematic analysis of KDD documentation alignment with implemented architecture  
**Scope:** Complete codebase analysis for dependency-ordered architectural recreation  

---

## Executive Summary

This audit reveals **SUBSTANTIAL ALIGNMENT** between KDD documentation and implemented architecture with **CRITICAL DEPENDENCY ORDERING ISSUES** identified for architectural recreation. The codebase demonstrates sophisticated implementation patterns that exceed original KDD specifications while maintaining architectural consistency.

### Key Findings

‚úÖ **STRENGTHS**:
- Comprehensive database schema implementation aligns perfectly with Epic 1-3 requirements
- AI prompt management system (Story 3.4) fully implemented with enterprise-grade features
- Multi-tenant architecture properly implemented with role-based access control
- Advanced logging and observability systems exceed original specifications

üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES**:
- **Epic Implementation Order**: Current implementation is story-driven, not epic-driven
- **Dependency Inversion**: Story 3.4 (AI Prompt Management) implemented before Epic 2 (Entity Management) completion
- **Foundation Gaps**: Some Epic 1 stories appear incomplete despite advanced features being implemented

## Critical Dependency Issues Identified

### üö® PRIMARY ISSUE: Epic Implementation Order Violation

**PROBLEM**: Story 3.4 (AI Prompt Management) has been implemented before Epic 2 completion, violating natural dependency order.

**ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT**:
- AI prompt system exists but may lack proper entity context
- Prompt variable system may not align with participant data structure
- Testing and validation patterns may be incomplete without entity foundation

**RECREATION RISK**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH** - Re-implementing in proper order may require refactoring

### üü° SECONDARY ISSUE: Epic 2 Completion Status Unclear

**PROBLEM**: Epic 2 (Entity & Relationship Management) status is ambiguous.

**VERIFICATION NEEDED**:
- Participant management frontend implementation
- Entity relationship validation
- Role-based access for participant operations
- Integration with Epic 3 incident capture
