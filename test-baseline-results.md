# Test Baseline Results - Before snake_case Field Migration

**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Purpose**: Establish baseline before converting all field names to snake_case  
**Decision**: Use snake_case for ALL field names, keeping external standards (BetterAuth) where required

## Test Results Baseline

### 1. Convex Tests
- **Status**: No test files found in `/apps/convex/` (tests are in centralized `/tests/convex/`)
- **Jest Config Tests**: 82 passed (configuration/environment issues with some tests)

### 2. Web Tests (via Turbo)
- **Total Test Suites**: 30 total (28 passed, 2 failed)
- **Total Tests**: 315 total (286 passed, 24 skipped, 5 failed)
- **Status**: **MOSTLY PASSING** - Some auth provider tests failing (expected)
- **Key Issues**: AuthProvider context issues in logging tests (not related to field names)

### 3. Worker Tests 
- **Total Test Suites**: 8 total (2 passed, 6 failed) 
- **Total Tests**: 110 passed
- **Status**: **COMPILATION ERRORS** - TypeScript issues in rate-limiter.ts (not related to field names)
- **Key Issue**: `rateLimiterDO.fetch()` argument count mismatch

### 4. Overall Assessment
- **Core Functionality**: Tests are passing where compilation succeeds
- **Field Name Issues**: No field name-related test failures detected  
- **Existing Issues**: Configuration/environment/compilation issues unrelated to naming

### 5. Baseline Summary
✅ **Safe to proceed** with snake_case field migration  
✅ **Good test coverage** exists to detect breaking changes  
❌ **Pre-existing test issues** (not related to field names) that should be fixed separately
