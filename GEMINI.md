# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to Gemini when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**SupportSignal Application** - A Next.js AI-powered application built from the starter-nextjs-convex-ai template designed for AI-first development using:

- **Next.js** (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Convex** for backend and real-time features
- **Tailwind CSS** + **ShadCN UI** for styling
- **Cloudflare** Pages/Workers for edge deployment
- **Bun** as the package manager

**Setup Reference**: Follow the [New Repository Setup Guide](docs/template-usage/new-repository-setup-guide.md) for complete deployment configuration.

## Import Path Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Use configured path aliases instead of relative imports.

**✅ Correct Import Patterns**:

```typescript
// Worker tests
import worker from '@/index'; // NOT: '../../../../apps/workers/log-ingestion/src/index'
import { RateLimiterDO } from '@/rate-limiter'; // NOT: '../../../../apps/workers/log-ingestion/src/rate-limiter'

// Web app
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'; // Standard alias pattern
```

**❌ Avoid These Patterns**:

```typescript
import worker from '../../../../apps/workers/log-ingestion/src/index'; // Ugly relative paths
import { Component } from '../../../components/ui/Component'; // Confusing navigation
```

**Configuration**: Path aliases are configured in Jest configs via `moduleNameMapper` - use them!

```

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Directory Structure

```
/
├── apps/web/           # Next.js application
│   ├── app/           # App Router pages and layouts
│   ├── components/    # React components
│   ├── lib/          # Utilities and shared code
│   └── convex/       # Convex backend functions
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/           # Shared UI components library
│   └── convex/       # Shared Convex schemas/helpers
└── tests/            # E2E Playwright tests
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Convex Integration**
   - All backend logic lives in `convex/` directory
   - Use `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks for data fetching
   - Real-time subscriptions are automatic with `useQuery`
   - Schema validation with Convex's built-in validators

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Server Components by default in `app/` directory
   - Client Components marked with `"use client"`
   - UI components use ShadCN pattern with Radix UI primitives
   - Form handling with `react-hook-form` and Zod validation

3. **State Management**
   - Server state: Convex (real-time, persistent)
   - Client state: Zustand (lightweight, type-safe)
   - Form state: react-hook-form with Zod schemas

4. **Authentication**
   - BetterAuth with Convex adapter
   - Session management through Convex
   - Protected routes using middleware

5. **Error Handling**
   - Sentry for production error tracking
   - Custom error boundaries for graceful degradation
   - Convex error handling with proper status codes

## Development Workflow

### AI-Assisted Development

This project follows the BMAD (Before, Model, After, Document) method with integrated CI verification:

#### BMAD Phase Integration with CI Verification

1. **Before Phase**:
   - Capture context before starting tasks
   - **CI Context Check**: Run `bun run ci:status` to verify starting state
   - Document current CI status in planning

2. **Model Phase**:
   - Use Gemini for implementation
   - **Include CI Considerations**: Plan implementation with CI compatibility in mind
   - Consider test requirements and CI pipeline impact

3. **After Phase**:
   - **MANDATORY CI Verification Suite**:
     ```bash
     pwd                    # Verify project root
     bun run typecheck     # TypeScript validation
     bun run lint          # ESLint compliance
     bun test              # Local test execution
     bun run build         # Production build test
     bun run ci:status     # CI pipeline verification
     ```
   - **DO NOT PROCEED** to Document phase until CI is green

4. **Document Phase**:
   - Document changes and learnings
   - **Include CI Lessons**: Capture any CI-related insights
   - Update testing documentation if CI patterns change

#### BMAD-CI Integration Rules

- **Never skip CI verification** in After phase - it's non-negotiable
- **CI failures block story completion** - fix before documenting
- **Document CI lessons** - maintain institutional CI knowledge
- **Adopt a tester persona** for complex CI debugging during any phase

### BMAD Documentation Structure

The project uses sharded documentation for AI agent consumption:

- **[docs/prd/](docs/prd/)** - Sharded Product Requirements (Epic 1-7)
- **[docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/)** - Sharded Architecture components
- **[docs/methodology/](docs/methodology/)** - BMAD methodology guides

For systematic development, reference specific epics and architectural components as needed.

### Testing Strategy

**CRITICAL**: ALL tests use centralized pattern in `tests/` directory, not app directories.

- **Unit tests**: `tests/{app}/src/` - utilities, hooks, individual functions
- **Integration tests**: `tests/{app}/integration/` - full workflows, cross-system
- **E2E tests**: `tests/e2e/` - critical user flows
- **Workers**: `tests/workers/{worker-name}/` - Cloudflare Worker testing

#### Testing Migration Quick Reference

**Before moving tests from app directories:**

1. **Create centralized structure**: `mkdir -p tests/{app-name}/{src,integration}`
2. **Move preserving structure**: Keep unit vs integration separation
3. **Update imports to use aliases**: `@/module` instead of `../../../../apps/`
4. **Update Jest config**: Set `rootDir: '.'` and proper path mapping
5. **Update package.json scripts**: Use centralized Jest configs
6. **Apply pragmatic TypeScript**: Use `@ts-nocheck` for interface issues
7. **Run from project root**: Always `pwd` first, execute from project root

**Detailed Guide**: [Test Migration KDD](docs/testing/technical/test-migration-and-configuration-kdd.md)

### CI Verification Process (MANDATORY)

**Critical Gap Identified**: Local tests passing ≠ CI success. The following systematic verification MUST be performed:

#### Before Story Completion (REQUIRED)

1. **Local Verification Suite**:

   ```bash
   # Run ALL verification commands in sequence
   pwd                    # Verify project root directory
   bun run typecheck     # TypeScript compilation check
   bun run lint          # ESLint validation
   bun test              # Unit tests (use npm test for React components)
   bun run build         # Production build verification
   ```

2. **CI Pipeline Verification**:

   ```bash
   # After pushing changes
   bun run ci:status     # Check current CI status
   bun run ci:watch      # Monitor CI execution (if running)

   # If CI fails, investigate immediately
   bun run ci:logs       # View detailed failure logs
   ```

#### Story Completion Checklist (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**NEVER mark a story as complete until ALL of these pass:**

- [ ] **Local TypeScript**: `bun run typecheck` passes with 0 errors
- [ ] **Local Linting**: `bun run lint` passes with 0 warnings
- [ ] **Local Tests**: All test suites pass (unit + integration)
- [ ] **Local Build**: `bun run build` completes successfully
- [ ] **CI Pipeline**: `bun run ci:status` shows SUCCESS for latest commit
- [ ] **Deployment**: Site accessible and functional (for main branch)

#### When CI Verification Fails

**Immediate Actions Required:**

1. **Don't ignore CI failures** - they represent production environment issues
2. **Fix before proceeding** - no new work until CI is green
3. **Document lessons learned** - update testing documentation
4. **Adopt a tester persona** - delegate complex CI debugging to a testing specialist mindset.

#### Integration with BMAD Phases

**Before Phase**: Verify CI status of current branch  
**Model Phase**: Include CI considerations in implementation planning  
**After Phase**: Mandatory CI verification before completion  
**Document Phase**: Capture CI-related lessons learned

### Deployment

#### Cloudflare Pages Configuration

- **Auto-deployment**: Configured for `main` branch via Git integration
- **Build Command**: `bun run build && bun run pages:build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Root Directory**: `apps/web`
- **Environment Variables**: `HUSKY=0` (required for CI)
- **Compatibility Flags**: `nodejs_compat` (required for Node.js runtime)

#### Critical Requirements

- **Next.js Config**: Must use `output: 'export'` for static generation
- **Images**: Must set `images: { unoptimized: true }` for Cloudflare compatibility
- **No wrangler.toml**: Use only Cloudflare Pages dashboard configuration
- **CI Compatibility**: Husky scripts must be disabled in CI environment

#### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Local testing
cd apps/web && bun run build:pages

# Manual deployment (testing only)
bun run pages:deploy

# Auto-deployment (production)
git push origin main  # Triggers automatic deployment
```

#### Troubleshooting

- See [Deployment Troubleshooting Guide](docs/technical-guides/cloudflare-pages-deployment-troubleshooting.md)
- Check build logs in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
- Verify compatibility flags are enabled for both Production and Preview environments
- **Dual Deployment Issues**: If seeing two deployments per commit, disable Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy in dashboard
- **Environment Variables**: If production shows localhost values, check GitHub repository secrets configuration

#### Convex Backend

- Convex functions deploy separately via `bunx convex deploy`
- Independent of Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Environment variables managed through Convex dashboard

## Important Conventions

1. **File Naming**
   - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
   - Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
   - Convex functions: camelCase (e.g., `getUsers.ts`)

2. **TypeScript**
   - Strict mode enabled for production code
   - Prefer interfaces over types for objects
   - Use Zod for runtime validation
   - Export types from Convex schemas
   - **For tests/interface issues**: Use `@ts-nocheck` pragmatically when TypeScript errors don't affect functionality

3. **Styling**
   - Tailwind utilities first
   - CSS modules for complex components
   - Follow ShadCN theming patterns

4. **Performance**
   - Use dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Optimize images with Next.js Image
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Cache Convex queries appropriately

# important-instruction-reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

## Quick Reference: Commonly Missed Patterns

**Before troubleshooting, check if we already documented the solution:**

1. **Testing Issues**: Check `docs/testing/technical/testing-infrastructure-lessons-learned.md`
2. **Jest Configuration**: Use templates in `docs/testing/technical/test-migration-and-configuration-kdd.md`
3. **TypeScript Errors in Tests**: Apply `@ts-nocheck` pragmatically - don't "fix" interface issues
4. **Path Resolution**: Use configured aliases (`@/`) not relative paths (`../../../../`)
5. **Directory Navigation**: ALWAYS `pwd` first, run commands from project root
6. **Test Location**: ALL tests go in `tests/` directory (centralized), not app directories
7. **Package.json Scripts**: Update scripts when moving tests to centralized location

**Documentation-First Protocol**: Search existing docs before implementing new solutions.

## Testing Philosophy and Practice

**CRITICAL**: When working on tests, a proactive and specialized testing mindset must be adopted. This means not just writing tests that pass, but architecting a robust and maintainable testing suite.

### Proactive Test Planning
**BEFORE implementing tests** (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- **Plan the test strategy**: Define the approach and patterns for the feature.
- **Define requirements**: What are the coverage requirements? What are the critical paths?
- **Confirm the framework**: Ensure the existing tools and setup are appropriate for the task.

### Diligent Test Implementation
**DURING test implementation**:
- **Isolate and debug**: When issues arise with the testing framework (e.g., Jest), address them systematically.
- **Handle complexity**: For complex scenarios like accessibility and user interactions, ensure tests are comprehensive.
- **Consider CI**: Write tests with the CI environment in mind.

### Thorough Test Review
**AFTER test implementation** (REQUIRED):
- **Review coverage**: Analyze test coverage and identify gaps.
- **Assess quality**: Evaluate the quality and maintainability of the tests.
- **Document learnings**: Capture any lessons learned, especially regarding the testing infrastructure.

### Pragmatic vs Perfectionist Testing Philosophy (Story 4.2 Lesson)

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**: After discovering 39 false test failures caused by overly precise expectations, the following testing philosophy MUST be followed:

**PRIMARY RULE**: Test what the function actually does, not what you think it should do.

**Precision Guidelines**:

- **BE PRECISE** for: Business logic, security, critical paths, data integrity
- **BE FLEXIBLE** for: Algorithm details, performance metrics, implementation specifics
- **ALWAYS VERIFY** expectations against actual function output before writing assertions

**Adopt a PRAGMATIC testing approach**:
- Use `toBeGreaterThan()`, `toBeLessThan()` for non-critical values
- Test behavior and outcomes, not implementation details
- Verify all numeric expectations by running the function first
- Document any precise assertions with comments explaining why
- When in doubt, ask for clarification about precision requirements

Reference: See `docs/testing/technical/pragmatic-vs-perfectionist-testing-kdd.md`

**Examples**:

```javascript
// ❌ Perfectionist (causes false failures)
expect(stats.characterCount).toBe(18); // Where did 18 come from?

// ✅ Pragmatic (tests actual behavior)
expect(stats.characterCount).toBe(text.length); // Matches implementation
expect(stats.characterCount).toBeGreaterThan(0); // Verifies function works
```

## Testing Documentation Priority

When asked about testing or testing-related documentation:

1. **Technical/Developer Testing**: Focus on `docs/testing/technical/` first
   - **Debugging issues**: Start with `testing-infrastructure-lessons-learned.md`
   - **Writing tests**: Use `testing-patterns.md`
   - **Setup/standards**: Reference `test-strategy-and-standards.md`

2. **Functional/UAT Testing**: Only include UAT files from `docs/testing/uat/` when specifically requested for functional testing

3. **Key principle**: Technical testing docs are for developers writing/debugging tests. UAT docs are for product validation. Don't mix contexts unless explicitly asked.

## File Creation Discovery Protocol

Before creating ANY new files, Gemini MUST follow this discovery protocol:

1. **Check Project Navigation**
   - Read `docs/index.md` first (central documentation navigation)
   - Check for existing patterns and directory structures
   - Look for relevant sections that show where new content should go

2. **Check BMAD Methodology**
   - Look for `.bmad-core/tasks/` directory for task-specific guidance
   - Check for templates in `.bmad-core/templates/`
   - Follow established naming conventions (e.g., `uat-plan-{epic}.{story}.md`)

3. **Verify File Placement**
   - Ensure new files follow existing documentation hierarchy
   - Update `docs/index.md` when adding new documentation
   - Use established directory patterns (e.g., `docs/testing/` for UAT files)

This protocol prevents incorrect file placement and maintains project consistency.

## Gemini Navigation & Directory Awareness

**CRITICAL**: Gemini must maintain directory context awareness to prevent navigation errors.

### Navigation Best Practices

**🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS run `pwd` as your FIRST command before any file operations!**

1. **MANDATORY directory verification before ANY commands:**

   ```bash
   pwd  # ALWAYS run this first - no exceptions!
   ```

2. **All commands must be run from project root:**

   ```bash
   # If not in project root, navigate immediately:
   cd /Users/davidcruwys/dev/clients/supportsignal/app.supportsignal.com.au

   # Then verify you're in the right place:
   pwd
   ```

3. **Use absolute paths when referencing project files:**

   ```bash
   # Good - paths from project root
   docs/testing/index.md
   apps/web/components/ui/button.tsx

   # Avoid relative paths that lose context
   ../../../.bmad-core/
   ../../docs/testing/index.md
   ```

   **NEVER use `../..` patterns - always reference files from project root.**

4. **Before running any bun/npm scripts, confirm location:**

   ```bash
   pwd && bun run ci:status    # Combine directory check with command
   ```

5. **When using LS tool, pay attention to the path context shown in output**

6. **For hidden directories (starting with .), use explicit listing:**
   ```bash
   ls -la | grep "^\."  # List hidden files/directories
   ```

### Common Directory Locations

- **Project Root**: `/Users/davidcruwys/dev/clients/supportsignal/app.supportsignal.com.au/`
- **Template Reference**: `/Users/davidcruwys/dev/ad/appydave/appydave-templates/starter-nextjs-convex-ai/`
- **Web App**: `apps/web/`
- **Convex Backend**: `apps/convex/`
- **Documentation**: `docs/`
- **Agent Configs**: `.bmad-core/` (if exists)
- **Claude Config**: `.claude/` (if exists)

### Troubleshooting Navigation Issues

If you get "file not found" or "script not found" errors:

1. **IMMEDIATELY run `pwd` to check current location**
2. **Navigate to project root:** `cd /Users/davidcruwys/dev/clients/supportsignal/app.supportsignal.com.au`
3. **Verify you're in the right place:** `pwd` (should show the full project path)
4. **Test with a known file:** `ls package.json` (should exist at root)
5. **Then retry your original command**

**Common failure pattern:** Running commands from subdirectories like `apps/web/` when scripts expect project root context.

## CI Verification Scripts & Monitoring Tools

### Available CI Monitoring Scripts

The project includes comprehensive CI monitoring tools to support systematic verification:

#### 1. **CI Status Check** (`scripts/ci-status.sh`)

```bash
# Usage: Check current CI status for branch
bun run ci:status [branch-name]

# Features:
- Shows recent CI runs with status and timestamps
- Displays current pipeline status (success/failure/running)
- Provides direct GitHub Actions link
- Exit codes: 0=success, 1=failure, others=various states
```

#### 2. **CI Monitor** (`scripts/ci-monitor.sh`)

```bash
# Usage: Monitor CI execution with timeout
bun run ci:watch [branch-name] [timeout-seconds]

# Features:
- Real-time CI monitoring with status updates
- Configurable timeout (default: 300 seconds)
- Exit codes indicate final CI state
- Automatic link to detailed logs on failure
```

#### 3. **Smart Push with CI Integration** (`scripts/smart-push.sh`)

```bash
# Usage: Intelligent push with pre-validation
bun run push

# Workflow:
1. Pre-push validation (lint, typecheck, test)
2. Git operations (add, commit, push)
3. Automated CI monitoring
4. Success/failure reporting with actionable feedback
```

### CI Integration Best Practices

#### Systematic Use Pattern

```bash
# 1. Before starting work - verify baseline
bun run ci:status

# 2. During development - local validation
bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun test

# 3. After implementation - comprehensive check
bun run build  # Verify production build
bun run push   # Smart push with CI monitoring

# 4. Story completion - final verification
bun run ci:status  # Confirm CI success before marking complete
```

#### Error Handling Workflow

```bash
# If CI fails after push:
bun run ci:logs        # View detailed failure logs
bun run ci:status      # Check current status
# Fix issues locally, then:
bun run push           # Re-push with monitoring
```

### Integration with Development Tools

#### GitHub CLI Integration

All CI scripts use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for authenticated API access:

- Automatic authentication detection
- Rich status reporting with timestamps
- Direct links to GitHub Actions dashboard

#### Exit Code Standards

- **0**: Success/completion
- **1**: Failure (CI failed, authentication issues)
- **2**: Cancelled operations
- **124**: Timeout reached
- **3+**: Various warning states

#### Monitoring Timeouts

- **Default**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) for most pipelines
- **Configurable**: Pass custom timeout as second argument
- **Smart Timeout**: Scripts provide progress updates and remaining time
